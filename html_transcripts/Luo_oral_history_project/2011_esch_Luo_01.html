<p><em>Recording now I'm going to start by asking you your name and Date of Birth?</em></p>
<p>Richard A-l- a-n-g-o last Name O-N-Y-I-N-O</p>
<p>I was born on the 4<sup>th</sup> June 1943 in a place in Western Kenya called Kisomo – Kisomo is now elevated to a City it is our major town within the Luoland yes</p>
<p><em>Do you have any brothers and sisters?</em></p>
<p>Yes, at the moment I have only one brother two died. One died in 1982 and the elder one died in 2002 and the other sister died in 2004, so we remain two brothers and two sisters. They are all in Kenya. Only me who is in England at the moment</p>
<p><em>And when did you come to England?</em></p>
<p>England, I first came in 1971</p>
<p><em>So you were now old?</em></p>
<p>On a training programme, I think I was less than 30 years I could be around 28. Yeah on a training programme which was offered to me by British council. And later extended by World Metrological organisation United Nations. So after completing my training here I went back</p>
<p><em>What was the training in?</em></p>
<p>I trained on various telecommunications equipment majoring on Insulation and commissioning of the Radar. Like the one that Heathrow terminal three. Yes that one we took part in the installation and commissioning in 1972 yes so I should say that I am diversified in some many areas. But my major training was electronics and telecommunication</p>
<p><em>Amazing, so can you tell me a little about your school days in Luoland?</em></p>
<p>School days was very, very competitive because in our land, I don’t know the number of the population at that time, what the figure we were at that time but I think the Kenyan population at independence was 6 million so Luos was the second largest tribe in Kenya could have around 1.5 or 2 million at that time, and there was only one missionary school for 2 million people, one missionary school so if you did not get into that school, that was the end of your career, finished, but the programme was we go through primary education after intermediate level standard 8 then you go to form one so if you got to that school , then you are assured of your future, even if you failed Cambridge school certificate exam, the exam use to be set by Cambridge, at the University here all for the commonwealth so if you sat it and passed it, then straight away after form 4 you just go to university, there was no A level at that time. So I was lucky, I was one of the people who had been admitted to Myseno secondary school and we excelled so well that was why we were properly trained after finishing our Cambridge school certificate.</p>
<p><em>Right so how long were you in school for, what age did you finish?</em></p>
<p>Oh, primary was standard 1 -4 you sit for an exam which qualifies you to go to standard 5 if you pass standard 5 then start 5 to standard 8 if you pass that exam then you go to form 1, for another four years all these were just for 4 years, for standard 1 – standard 4 – 4 years from standard 5 –to standard 8, 4 years from 1 to form 4 – 4 years after which you can look for a job or you can extend your education worldwide some people used to work I America but Britain didn’t allow anybody to come here unless you had a degree, to come and get your post graduate otherwise they did not allow us so most people went to America, yes.</p>
<p><em>So what was it like growing up in your village can you describes it for me a bit?</em></p>
<p>In the Village it was very interesting because we were under care of old people and they used to take care of us, very well. So boys used to herd cattle and sheep, goats. And er, girls used to help their mothers in getting firewood, fetching water from the rivers. So it was er, nice, because the life was generally it was just a free life. There was nothing like clothing you just walk naked, you had no blankets, if you had anything you put on the floor and you sleep that’s all, so our old grandmothers we used to sleep in our grandmothers houses so they put a fireplace there and that fireplace was your blanket as long as your feet were kept warm you just feel comfortable sleep the whole night, mosquitoes were biting us but we could not feel it</p>
<p><em>Could not feel the mosquitoes?</em></p>
<p>No we could not feel it we were used, we were used to and you know cow dung, cow dung they dry it and at night they put it on the fireplace and it gives a pungent smell I mean smoke which was hostile to the mosquitoes so they run out although you get a chocked you breath the smoke you continue sleeping until morning, so in the morning you go to school and if let’s say you got cloths out of the ashes of the dung you were feet would be very dirty so if you don’t wash your feet when going to school you would be caned through ally (laughs) by teachers</p>
<p><em>Was school very strict? </em></p>
<p>very very strict and the teachers were very very brutal they were very very brutal they Cain you probably it was not caning it was beating you don’t understand his subject you were in for it, you just the fault one way or another the school rules which were set for us to obey, like standing instructions in companies, t you don’t obey them properly you would be through ally beaten and a lot of people ran away from school, they never even finished two years in school cause it was an hostile environment</p>
<p><em>Was it all run by missionaries the school?</em></p>
<p>No, No, No, the primary schools was just local they were run by the government, yeah were had a district education board where the district education officer would come round and he would supervise teachers and see how they teach and the headmaster was given authority to instil discipline on his teachers and pupils so everything was just under the authority of the headmaster he could decide on what to do and what not to do, but then they education officers, who were whites who would go round in their vehicle supervising and seeing how they teach and run the schools, and they set time tables for closing and opening fro the whole year, first term was just like one year because it was long – yes.</p>
<p><em>So what was it like growing up, you must have learnt lots of things from your grandfather and father can you describe what it was like in the village? </em></p>
<p>The village was er, I mean it comprised <strong>of</strong> old people who could, take for example a village elder was given a lot of respect you could not, if it was the season for digging ploughing to plant you could not do it until he gives authority you could not plant seeds until he gives authority, when the crops were ready for eating he and his family were the first to eat than you could go to your garden and take a cob of maze or millet, if he refused you just leave your crop there even if they dry up and get wasted in the field, you can not take any home without his authority, there was a lot of discipline, so after harvest he could call upon the people around the village to contribute mainly millet African millet so there they prepared it, fermented it and made African brew and called the neighbours to come and enjoy they would slaughter one of the best bulls people eat they beat drums they dance the whole night to celebrate a good harvest if there was a problem in the village like some bodies son is misbehaving he would call the elders and the other grown up boys to discipline that boy who is misbehaving in the home he could be caned anything could happen to him. So there was a lot of disciplined during our days so anytime(phone goes off) paused anytime the people who had married young son with their wives they were briefed on how to run their families so if you did not run your family probably you would be called upon to explain why the wife was given freedom to complain to the grandmother and the grandmother who could take that complaint to the old men because as a woman married in that home there was no communication between her and the old men everything must pass through grandmothers. So if there is a problem they called upon you, you go and explain your problem why you could not stay peacefully with this woman and yet they had paid a lot of cows in the form of dowry, so there was disciplined. A boy who was in the field looking after cattle if he let some go astray into somebody’s field and they destroy the crops in the evening they could call other boys to disciplined him by caining him thoroughly. So there was lot of disciplined during those days.</p>
<p><em>So did you marry in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>I married in Kenya</p>
<p><em>And how did you find your wife?</em></p>
<p>Err we were staying in a certain estate caller Kibera in Nairobi err I was still young 24 and she was my neighbour a few houses from mine and I studied her very carefully and found that she was well disciplined and people it was a big struggle, people also wanted her very much. So I didn’t even let her complete school because I knew if she would have completed school I would not get her (laughs) so I just approached her one day and told her that I intended to ,marry her, and she refused so gave me 6 months to make up her mind that was in November 1967 so April 68 I went to her and said it is now 6 months have you made up your mind, she was a bit reluctant so her cousin she was living with her cousin I approached her cousin which was my best friend and give me the Green light. So one day I just went to her house I was doing my City and guilds exam I finished the exam very -very quickly I hired a taxi and went to her house found her there alone and I told her okay so today you are a wife you are no longer a girl in this house you are going with me whether you like it or not, so the taxi driver also helped me to enforce(laughs) the law on her we told her to gather anything she wanted before her cousin came back for lunch so that was how we went and we went for good. And in our culture if you tell a girl that she is married and that she is now married she cant go back home by our culture, so I married her and then I told her okay now I will sponsor you for further studies you will now be studying in my house while as my wife because I knew if she had continued with school those people would grab you before I take you so that is now we got married and I gave her the best training until she climbed up to the top most secretarial post in Kenya so I gave her a lot of freedom she became one of the top secretaries for Kenya airways yes</p>
<p><em>So do don’t most when you ask to marry someone in Kenya don’t you have to provide a dowry?</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Did you provide a dowry?</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Now much?</em></p>
<p>After I stayed with her but because another culture in Luoland you can not pay a dowry when a woman is pregnant so I made sure she got pregnant immediately so that I had tine to collect (laughing) money for two years (Laughs)</p>
<p><em>You cheeky Devil so what was the dowry?</em></p>
<p>Er The dowry in luoland dowry does not end I remember my mother in 1979 that is when my father paid the last dowry and she was a married in 1936</p>
<p><em>My goodness</em></p>
<p>Yes so you can pay dowry as and when they want it but initially, they will tell you ok, give us so much, me I paid money, so money at that time err I paid two thousand Kenya shillings, which was alot of money in 1969, it could would have been well over three thousand pound now, yes so I stayed for a while, then now it was the turn of my Father, as a Son to also help me paid dowry, so he took some cows from his home state and they took them to my Father in law, and that one completed dowry</p>
<p><em>How many cows</em></p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p><em>So that is a good dowry isn’t seven cows </em></p>
<p>Yeah it is good</p>
<p>What is the averaged?</p>
<p>The average was around err, when I was paying two thousand, at that time a hundred shillings because err, a hundred shilling, how many hundred of shilling in a thousand? Ten</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>So by that time you could get a bull, at less than hundred shillings, so two thousand was alot of cows, maybe over twenty at that time, that is why they gave me a breathing space for many years because I had paid a lot [laughing]</p>
<p><em>That wonderful, so growing up there you learnt things like, what did you learn as far as in the home state</em></p>
<p>In the form off</p>
<p><em>Well fishing, well fishing and hunting</em></p>
<p>No we were not near the lake</p>
<p><em>You were not</em></p>
<p>No we were fourteen miles from the lake, but err we used to mostly look after cattle’s, and during that period, you play a games, I mean you exchanged ideas, and err when the crops are ready around August or July, in fact maize, mostly people like millet more than maize, that is why they didn’t contact disease like diabetes, because err millet is not very rich in starch,</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yeah maize is very rich in starch, it bad so maize was some how not liked very much, so you could just go to somebody’s err um field and take any amount of maize you want, and roast them and eat, they couldn't make noise, it was the order of the day for young boys, who are looking after cattle yeah, and err during that time, the err what I should say, ooh the bushes were very -very dens ,very -very dens, because people were few, and so if we went to look after cow, or you had some goats and some sheep, and you are alone Leopards could just come from nowhere and pick, any from the herd, so we were all the time we were under supervision of old people, you are there looking after the cow or goats or sheep, but they seating some where watching if there is anything bad which can happen, until late in the evening when you take them home, for milking, and for up keep until the following day morning, but other wise life for young people was god, we sometimes err if it was during the raining season, we don’t need to go to the river to wash, we just get out in the rain as it rain you just clean your self and go and sleep, that is all because we didn’t valued clothing very much, it was very difficult for people to afford a pair of shorts was like err fifty cents, Kenya shillings but very few people could afford that, so we were used to walking naked, you see until when we went to upper classes, and then we had to cover our selves</p>
<p><em>Yeah, how old was your grandfather when he died </em></p>
<p>I don’t know, my grandfather, for my father died in 1952, I don’t know how old he was, because my father was born in 1915, and he was the last born</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So I know my grandmother died at the age of between hundred and ten and hundred and twenty</p>
<p><em>How did you know that?</em></p>
<p>They used to calculate my uncle, I had one of my uncle who was highly educated, err he went to secondary school in thirties</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>So history could tell him that err at the time my grandmother was growing, he could calculate that time base on the history, that was taught at school, and the calculate and come to the average age of my grandmother, so that is how we could tell, yes</p>
<p><em>My goodness do you remember any stories from her </em></p>
<p>Yeah they used to tell us a lot of stories, especially when we go, before we retired to bed, they had to tell us stories and we also tell them stories we learned in school, because in school story telling was a must, it was one of the err, it was in the syllabus, so any time after teacher has taught arithmetic, and some other subject, and then he leaves you time to tell stories, but my grandmother used to tell us a lot of stories, like one of them was, they believed that the sun had a good omen or bad omen, so we were not allowed to go out at night, because they believed that, when the sun set, it will moved at night when people are sleeping to go to the East, to rise again, so if you woke up even to go and pass urine at night and by bad luck you see the sun, and err the sun throws anything to you like a rope or a hoe, you know a hoe? Yeah for digging, if you get a hoe, it means that you are cause through out you life time, you will be, every time you have a child they will die and you dig the grave to burry them, but if you get a rope it means that you are blessed, you will have a lot of cattle to tie them with the rope err where they are suppose to stay at night, so we faired, no matter how much you wanted to urinate you just hold your self till morning [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] your grandmother must have been an amazing teacher</em></p>
<p>Ooh yes she was, we had a, my grandfather had two wives, my real grand Mother was a conservative, she didn’t like talking too much, so we could go to the, my younger grandmother and we stayed there the, we could stayed there must of the time sleep there, because she was flexible and could tell us a lot of stories, even teachers, even teach the girls, how to stay um how to stay with the, how to lead there family when they are married, yes because they didn’t like girls misbehaving, because cows where just like a blessing to them, the more you had the more you are respected in the village, so if you had a girl who is attractive and who are well behaved, and could make you get cows from err, from there good married, they really look after them properly ,and gave them the good teaching about life, in the villages and how to lived life with the in-laws, and other such like things</p>
<p><em>Yeah, there were strike rules with like how they should trait the in- laws and things like that</em></p>
<p>Yes yeah there was strike law, strike laws</p>
<p><em>Right </em></p>
<p>Yes strike laws</p>
<p><em>Right, so you had in a sense then you had your grandfather had two wives</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>You had two grandmothers </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>How many wives did your father had</em></p>
<p>Two</p>
<p><em>Two, so was that the standard, or did people had more than one</em></p>
<p>Not the standard you could have three, four, five, six, seven, depending on how wealth you are</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Because you could not get them free, you had to pay dowry</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And some you could send even twenty cows, ten, and fifteen, so if you don’t have them, you could not afford to married more than one wives, yeah so polygamy was left to people who were rich yes</p>
<p><em>Did you father had all his teeth</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So he didn’t have any removed</em></p>
<p>No six</p>
<p><em>He had six removed</em></p>
<p>Six this lower one</p>
<p><em>Right </em></p>
<p>Were removed</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>How old was he when he had them removed</em></p>
<p>No I don’t know, because I was born and found them with out this</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yes, but I think they were removed when they were about err after the milk teeth are gone</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So the moment you had permanent teeth, they removed them, because if the removed them, when you still had milk teeth, they will grow again</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah of course </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>And that was because of lock jaw was it</em></p>
<p>It was a err costume, costume and err lock jaw as well, but mostly if somebody was sick, was sick he can not eat, he can not talk, and they want to put even porridge in to his mouth if he, if his teeth are tight there was no way of opening them, but if you had a gap down here, you could used that gap to open the lower, the upper teeth and put something in the mouth, it was advantageous as well,</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So that was the main thing about the laws that you had your teeth removed was there any other thing, that how you could recognise a member of the Lou community </em></p>
<p>That was only the teeth at that time, but old people had beads, put on their ears, this ear loops</p>
<p>Right</p>
<p>They had err special beads, not just ordinary, special, I don’t know where they got them from, but they were very expensive, because each you had to pay a cow, so if you are very rich, you could put ten here and ten this side, or five and five yes</p>
<p><em>You will knew how rich some one was</em></p>
<p>Um</p>
<p><em>You knew how rich someone was</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>By how many</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Ooh how lovely </em></p>
<p>Yes, yes</p>
<p><em>Yeah that is really nice</em></p>
<p>And again, my you know we stayed in err there are some Lou in Uganda, all thou xxx[Acholi] we called them xxx[Acholi ] in Sudan they are called Dinka, this are our people who remain behind on the river Nile, but they told us a story, there was a conflict, between two brothers, in Uganda, when one of the brothers was very rich, so he called a specialist to come and put the beads, on his ears, so his brother had a small child, so the small child went to, went to study how this, just sat near this old people who are doing this things, and he just look at them what it was, how it was been done, unfortunately he took one of the beads, and xxx[swallow], so the brother said no, I brought this man, I have paid him, so many cows, to do the beads on my ears, and I can not afford having one less, on one of my ears, told his brother you most give me, my bead now, whether you like or not, and a fight and sued, so the brother got annoyed, and said ok I can not afford to get you beads and it is too late, this man has come and you had paid him, and he most finish the job he was paid for, I will get you your bead, so he took the child, cut open the stomach, and found the bead and give him</p>
<p><em>Ooh my god</em></p>
<p>But he did not give him face to face, he gave him back, I mean with hands at the back, he didn’t want to see his brothers face, because what he did to him, was very- very, I mean err unbearable</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>So he told him ok, my brother, you made me killed my child because of the bead, we shall never see eye to eye again, so we were told we are the descendent, of this man who left Uganda and came and settled around lake Victoria, where the Lou are now, and those people the other s remain back in Uganda, and that is why they said historically brother Lou’s they don’t see eye to eye, they hate each other, in fact if it is something which was inherited, from that incident, it is very sad, because I may, I have a brother but, we don’t love each other</p>
<p><em>That is very sad</em></p>
<p>It is a very sad thing</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>Um, he would be happy to see my down fall, than my success, I he would even fight, for my down fall, that is typical Lou’s up to today, we were told historically, or through stories that, that is we are now reaping what happened in Uganda, that was one of the stories</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>There was also a man, who played I don’t know whether he played magic, but he is still a legend, in the Lou land up to today, he could turn into anything, he really miss treated the err the first settlers, from Briton or from Europe who settled in Kenya, he could turn in to anything even a snake, a goat, a dog, so when they were chasseing him, he could disappeared and then come and meet them again in the form of a goat, or in the from of a dog, or in the form of a woman, so they asked have you seen that man who was running, or yes he has past he has just gone that way , yet is the same man now in the form of a woman, so whether it was true or not, we don’t know but that legend is still there up to today</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>There is even a football club named after him, and they believed that, this football club can turn miracles, they can even score goal where and you don’t know the goal was scored, that store is still there</p>
<p><em>Yeah amazing</em></p>
<p>There was one, who xxx there was a tribal conflict, conflict in that tribe, that clan fighting this clan, and such like things, there is one who was err name, who was said to be so strong that the xxx [Kalenjin] who are our neighbours, they were very good in staling cows at night, but he was so strong that he fought them single handed, and push them from the err plans around lake Victoria, where we lived, up to the hills which are very cold, so his body was just like a stone even if you spear it, the spear just brake in to pieces, so this people did not know, why he had such a strength, so one day, they gave him a girl form their home to go and study, why this man, I mean why this man behave this way, where is the secret of his strength, so one day, he fell sick, so he told the err the [Kalenjin]xxx wife, who was not a Lou, to cut his skin, and rape there some medicine, but this woman err, I am just cutting a stone, this is a stone, your body is hammered, it is like a stone, he said don’t tell anybody, just cut my shadow, so when that woman cut the shadow, blood came out, and put rub the shadow with medicine and the man got cured, after a while the lady disappeared, went and told her people that, this man powers is on his shadow, so next time you go and fight, just pear the shadow, so when the fight broke out again, they really fought very had to get to the shadow, and when they spared the shadow, the man died, up to today, and when he died he turned in to a stone</p>
<p>Right</p>
<p>Up to today that stone is there, and it is a monument, which even tourist go to watch, when they visit that area</p>
<p><em>What the stone called </em></p>
<p>Err xxxx xxxx xxxx means a stone xxx was his name, so the Lou still believed that, if you are going hunt animals, and you sharpen your spare or what every you sharpen on this stone, and you see an animal running and you throw it the animal will not escape, you will get your catch that day</p>
<p>So Lou, are good hunters</p>
<p>Yeah they are good hunters, good hunters and good fishermen</p>
<p><em>Right I suppose that is why, is that how you kept health </em></p>
<p>Yeah, because of fish, um because of fish, and err we were told that err, there is a certain typer of oil, the head of the err tilapia, which is very good and it boost intelligent, because err when err the missionary came and they started this schools like where I I mean I learn, they found that Lou were very -very intelligent, give them any subject , they were just number one, and they try to find out why, they found that it was associated with err oil from the fish, and it is just in the head not this err fillet which people like , just the head, yes, so that is how it is,</p>
<p><em>Why do you think people lived so long? </em></p>
<p>People lived so long, because they had no stress, they were happy with the environment the only thing which gave them a lot of problem, where the sickness, but they knew how to go about it, they had very special herbs for any types of treatment, which they used even in my father was a good heeler of snake bits</p>
<p><em>Really</em></p>
<p>Yes, one day he saw some snakes fighting, and he kept watch, then one killed the other, and then went an pick a certain leaf, and came and put in the mouth of this one which was dead, and it just woke up and went it own way, so he went and pick that leaf, and he ran away, because I am told that, if the snake would, the one which heel the other would be very -very vigilant, and look for any body who is going to pick this leaf, and will chase you even mile and miles, and he run away fro some month, then came back, so it is this herb, which if you are beating by snake, they just pound it, pound it and squeezed it on the wound, and some you were given with water to drink, and that is the end of it</p>
<p><em>My goodness</em></p>
<p>And he heel a lot of people, of snake bites, and there are lot of some other err herbs for different disease like malaria and such like things, so they lived longed, because people had no worry, there worry was only food and food was plenty fruits was were plenty, fruit were growing in the wild very many, and you know fruit will provide vitamin C to heel the wound, if you had a wound, or such like things, so they didn’t worry any thing , and they knew that err mortality rate was very high, because they way thy look after their children was not good enough, children were just walking necked, not given proper food, they could die from in hygienic h condition, so that is why they had many wives and many children that some will die, some will remain, because I know my grandmother had fourteen children, twelve died and only two remained my father and his sister, twelve died</p>
<p><em>My goodness, what did they all die before certain age</em></p>
<p>Ooh yeah, before ten</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Before ten, mortality rate was very high before ten, after ten survival was err good</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>Um survival was good</p>
<p><em>So when you first came to the UK, in 72 was it? 72</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>What was your first reaction? When you arrived here</em></p>
<p>Ooh it was good, it was good, and we were thoroughly brief by British council in Nairobi, what we expected the good and the bad, and we knew how to go about it, so err we were met, that time underground was only up to Victoria station, so we were told to take a coach from Heathrow to Victoria, and there we were met by some official from British high commission, British council I mean, and then they brief us, give us pocket money and then they gave us tickets to go to where we were going to take our courses, we liked it um at you know during that time, not few Africans had a chance to come to Briton, and there you could find some places like where we went Isles of white, that is isolated island, not much very much exposed to tourism and err from African and the rest, so seeing blacks was something strange to them, but we coup up with the xxxx situation</p>
<p><em>It there a lot of racism</em></p>
<p>I don’t know whether it was racism, but err I remember one day, we went to a pub, and when we enter the pub everybody went out in the protest, why we were allowed in we were five from Africa, so we were amazed we just look at the bar man and he looked at us, without talking so one of us ask him, do you have any the strongest beer, because in Kenya we are used to very strong beer, so he gave us one which was called best biter, and we drank everything in the bar, any strong beer we swept clean , so the man got happy, because we had made his day, he made more money then he could get from this soft drinks, somebody drinking a glass for two hours, so he was happy he told us gentlemen, come tomorrow leave those people alone, so the following day when we went, we found this people, he had brief them, that you know this people made me, I mean made me more money than you people, so when we went they didn’t go out, they just watch us how we were drinking some started playing snooker with us, and little bit we become very good friend, very -very good friend, we where invited by Lion clubs, we went for a party, the party which turned nasty [laughing] because one of us was a very good dancer, so when was there music, this man asked err somebody if he could dance with his wife, so xx sure- sure just go ahead we are in a party don’t worry, so the man started dancing rumba , you know rumba? Um you know rumba</p>
<p><em>Rumba yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah so he turned round, turn round, turn round, the husband was watching and he was not happy, the way they were dancing , so he just came and slap this man very hard and he fall down unconscious , that was the end of that party, we wondered so what is, this was sort of entertainment , why did he why should the our friend be beating so much, in fact it, I don’t know whether he broke his jaw he had to be taken to hospital, that was the only incident , which was not good, but otherwise, we liked it, we stayed there and then went to xxx[macony] college in Chelmsford, and so many other places, but where we are some how we can meet hostile reception, sometimes it could be ok, and we were, we just lived with it, we didn’t care very much</p>
<p><em>What was the big different between coming here and been in Nairobi or you village, was there a huge difference</em></p>
<p>There is a huge difference, because is a civilized err country with it so many opens, there things which we just read in books, like snowing, the seasonal weather here four season, there we had only one season, and of course we had sun light, from morning to evening 24 hours a day through out the year, the only thing we called a season is during raining season, when there is long rain, long raining season from March to June, and short raining season from October to December, that all, so when we came here we learn a lot, and err things which we could not see back at home , we saw it again</p>
<p><em>Like what</em></p>
<p>Like err hovercraft that was our time to travel by hovercraft, across the channel between Southampton and err isles or white, we couldn't image something err floating on water and going almost seventy MPH, that was amazing to us , and it was also our first time, we were the first lot to travel by jumbo jet 747, yeah bowing 747 from Nairobi, that was it first flight to Africa</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yeah so, we were very happy about it, clothing and the rest, we found that we could buy very good things, and we could also learn a lot on the form of TV programs, and the engineering was very good, something which we could not be taught at home, so we had the best training of our time, we had the best</p>
<p><em>Was the idea to trained you here and then for you to go back to </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>That was the whole xxx right</em></p>
<p>Yeah because err our government bought a lot of equipment from err, from British government</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So the condition of the purchased was that they had to give after sales service, in the form of training, so that when we go back, we look after this equipment, yes as maintenance engineers</p>
<p><em>Did you pay, were you paid to do the training?</em></p>
<p>No that one was paid by the was in the err packed yeah so, I think when our government was buying equipment the training was one of the conditions in the purchased yeah, so what we were given was , we were given free ticket free accommodation and free pocket money</p>
<p>How much was the pocket money</p>
<p>Ooh [laughing] it was seventeen pee per day,</p>
<p><em>God, but I suppose that was alot then</em></p>
<p>It is a lot of money</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>It was a lot of money, because I understand during that time minimum wage, was fifty five pee per hour, yeah but it was a lot of money, life was good, and our money was stronger than the British money at that time yes</p>
<p><em>So you did your training and then you where here for how many years training</em></p>
<p>Ooh radar training took us six months, because radar was more complex, and transmitter training took us another six month at xxx college, then other small equipment here and there, xxx and company I don’t know where it now, and recall company, communication equipment also took us, in total it took us one year two month, yes but err the other potion of it was founded by United Nations, which gave us a lot of money, one thousand pound per month</p>
<p><em>Each right, so you must have gone home with lot of money </em></p>
<p>Err lot of money, when we went back home, we were kings</p>
<p><em>Really</em></p>
<p>Yes we liked it [laughing] and even that time, we were been told that err, it would be better if we were employed here, because we got the training, which could not be offered to locals, so I know I was err offered a job to go in Porto-Rico to do the installation of radar there, but I didn’t want because I had a, I had my young family back at home, and life there was also very good, and we were also told that ok, if you stayed in Briton for two years with out going out, if we are not arrested then automatically you become a British , but then we decided to go home, non of us stayed back, yes so later we were brought again for further training</p>
<p><em>So when you went back, what was like going back?</em></p>
<p>Ooh we were heroes, it was err we appeared on TV, radio and everything, during all our training here was filmed, and taken back home, to show the people how this people where training , and how good it is to joined that the organisation, they will offer you better training and future, and we were given very senior post, because we were taken over expatriate, expatriate had been there from time in memorial , so we were the first African to take over from them, so we were taken, we were really looked after properly yes</p>
<p><em>That most had been really good for taken over from expats</em></p>
<p>Ooh yes it was good</p>
<p><em>Pride and country </em></p>
<p>Yeah pride, yes</p>
<p><em>So what job did you do when you went back?</em></p>
<p>Me when I went back in particular, I was in charged of airports, installations all over East Africa Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, so anytime there was a problem in Uganda ooh where is Richard ticket straight away to Uganda, straight away to Tanzania and Kenya all round, and I enjoyed life, it was as if I was a pilot, because all the time I was flying, going to help those people put, I mean repaired the equipment, yes</p>
<p><em>So how long did you do that for?</em></p>
<p>Ooh many years until community broke up, community broke up East African community, comprising Uganda and Tanzania and Kenya; it was just like one region, but when something happened to the country that the politicians, became hostile to each other then each one, each country decided to go it own way, in 1977, then that was the end of it, and I also didn’t want to carry my services on to Kenya government, so I left an rejoined private sector,</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So when you came back to the Uk again, when was that</em></p>
<p>That was 1979,</p>
<p><em>And that because, why did you come back in 79</em></p>
<p>I was err I was working for a xxx East Africa, you know err did you hear about xxx, yeah I work for him, he had forty seven companies in Kenya, so I was a manager in one of his companies, so I did so well, err my department did so well, the turnover was twice the figure which was given to me, and so I was offered a free holiday, one month stay with my family, in London, that is when I came back, and from then my wife was also, had also joined the Kenya air ways, and we were entitled to free ticket all over the world, so I started just venturing in to travelling, in fact Briton just became like home. I could come any time I felt like, there was no visa, you only had a passport and a ticket and you go, yeah visa restriction just came in 1996, yes, yeah</p>
<p><em>So you kind of moved around from seventy seven</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Yeah so when did London really become your home then</em></p>
<p>Ooh, things, when things became very bad, back at home, I sent my children here in 1995, yes to come and stay</p>
<p><em>When you say went bad, what you mean by went bad</em></p>
<p>Politics, yeah politics was very bad, very- very bad, so I had for seen, that the future was going to be dark, it was not going to be bright for any body at all, so I moved my children here, and it so happed that err you this err problem like you have seen in Libya, tribal conflict like Kenya you know err when there is a err incumbent, or in power he just looks after his own tribe, he doesn’t care about other people, and if you complain you suffer for it, if you complain you suffer for it, not jobs no anything no future, even say you find that no matter how intelligent, or clever you child is, he will not make it, when it comes to exams, he is given a grad lower than the average pass fro university, so that they don’t go to university such like things, so I had seen that this things were not going to work well, and they proved me right, when i brought my children here, every body follow suit, people came here in large numbers</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So what did you do when you first came, when you came back here, did you work or</em></p>
<p>No, I was a business man, yes because err during my time, when I was working for the three government of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania East African Community, I was in charged of procurement</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So I knew so many companies in Briton, supplying what and what, and I knew who the uses back home, so I could just go err ok we want this, do you know where to get it? yes I know here is an order , sometimes they give me an order of twenty thousand pound, I come here get the items I supplied and I lived very comfortably</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>Yes that is how I lived</p>
<p><em>Did you find out this country had changed a lot when you came back</em></p>
<p>Yeah when I came back, I find err there were lot of changes because, a lot of people had now come in, and err movement, I mean integration yeah was now very good, you could you mingle with people, you don’t have any problem and I liked it, and the other thing I like was err if you are here, you make you base here, and you asked for curtained item from here, you would easily be treated very well than when you are back at home, because if you are back at home they don’t take you seriously , let say if I want something from Cambridge, there is a company in Cambridge and I want something, and if I ring from Nairobi Kenya, ok we shall look in to it, and that is the end of, but if am from London ok we shall send it to you ok all right, I just go there personally, I just go there personally and get it done, and they will do it while you a waiting, like I remember when I came here to buy studio lunch for Kenya broadcasting cooperation, I rang somebody in xxxx he told me no, no those things are not with me, mine are different go to Hanger lane, on central line, and you will get such and such company they will deal with your case, when I rang those people told me come with have them, and they pack them in a very big, a very big box , I took them back, and err there I was , of course I remember when my children came here, I had a lot of money, I gave them a lot of pocket money, they stayed for a very long time with out even going in to benefit, um</p>
<p><em>And they all over her now are they</em></p>
<p>Yeah they are all over here</p>
<p><em>So how many children have you got</em></p>
<p>Five one is back at home, who was married before they came</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>But these ones are five,</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>With the grandchildren I have</p>
<p><em>How many</em></p>
<p>Here I have nine, home three</p>
<p><em>Have you been back to Kenya since you came here?</em></p>
<p>No, when I came here I was very sick, I had a very high blood pressure, two hundred over one thirty, I al most died, so they have tried to control it, now it is slightly bit back to normal, because you know the pressure up there is very high, no inside s low, inside the plan</p>
<p><em>It low pressure isn’t it </em></p>
<p>Yes, so if you pressure is high all ready, and you fly you can just die inside there, so I was advice not to fly, it was not my intension to stayed, because I knew I could make a lot of money back at home and feed this people, without them struggling very hard yes, which I still intend to do, now I have been given err, what is it, clean bill of health to fly, so am planning to go home anytime now</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So, how difference would you describe living here to livening in Kenya, so I know we got to finish soon, because I promise, you would be off at four so</em></p>
<p>Here, if I had a job, it is good; it is good in that you are not boarded with so many things African socialism, where you take care of so many people, and again back at home because of lack of jobs, so many people are job less, they result to lawlessness, if you have you don’t live a good life, even at night they just err attach you in your , break the doors and windows and take everything they want, so every time you don’t know what would become of you the following day, but here life is ok, as long as you have something to survive on you are just ok there is no problem, yeah</p>
<p><em>That was lovely thank you very much </em></p>
