<p>Kenya, Nairobi.</p>
<p><em>Nairobi</em></p>
<p>Mhmmm</p>
<p><em>So you grew up in the city.</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Yeah, and what did your parents do for work? </em></p>
<p>Mmmm, my mum was a housewife and she used to do small business initially and my dad work for the post office as a s-, engineer, was a supervisor.</p>
<p><em>And did you have any brothers or sisters?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, we had ten</p>
<p><em>Ten, wow.</em></p>
<p>Five girls, five boys</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>It’s a big family, isn’t it.</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>What was, what was that like growing up with so many brothers and sisters around?</em></p>
<p>Well it was nice, the house was always busy and on top of that you have aunties, you have uncles, you have, er, you have a house maid, so there’s, the house was always full. So it was, it was interesting, it was nice. Noisy.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>I can imagine</em></p>
<p>And my mum was always busy cooking alot of food, we had a lot of food, we had. My dad had to buy a lot of food, so it was plenty of food in the house.</p>
<p><em>What kind of things would your mother cook for you when you were a child?</em></p>
<p>Erph, mostly the normal, Gali, you know Kenya Gali, sucoma wiki, meat, cabbages. Of course we love Chapatis, we cooked alot of Chapatis, beans and rice. Rice not so much, but yeah. On Christmas days, special occasions. Yeah</p>
<p><em>Sounds fantastic</em></p>
<p>We have that, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did your mother teach you to cook as well?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes! I was erm, there were four girls I had with me. No, three girls, so, so for a while I was the youngest girl so of course, I had to learn from them. So I didn’t do much cooking but I have to learn. My mum did most of the cooking and then my eldest girls, but I had to cook, because once the eldest one went, I had to take care of the little ones.</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>‘cause I had, I was in the middle, I’m the fifth one. So, I had five behind me.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>So I had to cook for them. So I had to manage....</p>
<p><em>And, and w-, do you think that was quite traditional really, that the girls would learn to cook from their mother and...</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, we have to.</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>We have to cook, we have to wash, we have to clean. Yeah we have to do that. Boys, not so much.</p>
<p><em>What kind of things would the boys do then?</em></p>
<p>Er, because we lived in the village, er not in the village, in the city, ‘cause I had an older-, but most of the boys were young. I don’t know what they did. They just tidied their room or just play. Really, I can’t remember much ‘cause we used to do the washing, we did the cleaning, we did the ironing. Maybe just going to buy things in the shops. I can’t remember boys doing much....</p>
<p><em>[laughs] </em></p>
<p>....really, maybe, occasionally sweeping the compound.</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Yeah, or if there’s a dog, taking the dog out. Such, such things.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Brilliant, and, and did you go to school, in, in Nairobi?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Which, which school did you go to?</em></p>
<p>I went to primary school, Martin Luther Primary School. Then I went to Precious Blood Secondary School. It was one of the best, it was a, run by, is a Catholic school actually. Run by German sisters. It was one of the best schools. The top schools in Kenya. Precious Blood Girls School in, I can’t remember xxxxx, I can’t remember yeah, yeah then I went to xxxxx Girls for my A-level.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>From there I finished, I went to xxxxx University</p>
<p><em>Oh wow</em></p>
<p>For my degree.</p>
<p><em>What did you study?</em></p>
<p>I did agricultural economics.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Yeah, Bsc.</p>
<p><em>A-er -and, ah, do you have any enduring memories of your school days? Or your time at university, that kind of you know, big events or moments in your life that you would like to talk about?</em></p>
<p>Erm, school, I can I remember because we live in an estate. It was a relatively new estate, called Buro Buro which was quite far. My school, can, was it five or ten miles, but what I can remember is we had to walk a long distance to school. May be ten, fifteen miles, I can’t remember, but early in the morning with my brothers and sisters, we have to run to school. Be there by 8 O’clock. If you’re late of course there’s a cane and then at lunch time, we have to take the same journey, run back home. Eat lunch quickly, then run back to school [laughs]. You know? For the afternoon lessons. May be only in the evening then it will be leisurely ‘cause you, there’s no rush, you can just walk. But I remember running a lot. And walking a lot. And we just. That’s primary because it was quite a distance. It wasn’t easy to get to school nearby so. So what I can remember of school is the running and the, the long journey, and also there’s a big compound so we used to do a lot of cross country, a lot of games, so. There was a lot of sports. And I think that’s why even I started running cross country because is, you’re always running, you’re always have to be on time. There’s no question about it. Now so that’s for my school day, that was something that really stick out from there, started running, running a lot. Yes.</p>
<p>You must have been very good at cross country [laughs]</p>
<p>Oh yeah, yeah, I did. When I went to secondary I used to run from, not the best, but I ran for my school team. For the cross country because there it was just you have to go for the nationals, so it was just running. I think it’s come from the Kenyan. Kenyan blood. The long distance runner [laughs].</p>
<p>[Laughs].</p>
<p>‘Cause we do a lot of running</p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p>Yeah, secondary school, cause it was a Catholic school. What was good about it was a discipline. It was very nice. Because it was a girls school. So, they really taught us a lot of cleanliness. I remember the school was always the top for cleanliness. Because after the school in the evening, each house, every girl had to go in to cleaning duties. Toilet, dusting the skirting boards, so everything had to be clean. So this school you couldn’t find a paper down. So, the cleanliness was good, the beds when you wake up in the morning, they had to be straight and they have to be checked. Your school, your shoes even, where you hang your panties, all have to be neat and tidy. Everything! So the discipline and the cleanliness, that’s something I really learnt from, from secondary school and in, from the nuns you know? And of course there was also devotion, their prayer, evening mass, morning mass. And erm, and theirs teaching was quite good, ‘cause we really did, I did quite well in my secondary ‘cause really discipline and good teaching.</p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p>You know? And the sports, we also did a lot of Hockey. It was quite, I was in the Hockey team, so it was a good school for hockey. One of the top.</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>For hockey, Hockey nationals in, So I enjoyed my-,doing the cross-country and doing the hockey. Hockey team and the schools sports and also in class. So it was well all round. It was, it was really good. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sounds wonderful.</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Sounds really good.</p>
<p>Yeah and then [coughs], I went to stay at Statehouse Augustus for sixthform. That’s just sss-, it was much in the city. ‘cause Statehouse is just next to the Statehouse itself yeah the presidents estate. Yeah so those were very short yeah, just three years xxxxx. It was just next to their univers-, so it was just starting to put in the life of university and life after school. You know so, there are also playing hockey and again the discipline is not as good as with the secondary school with the nuns school yeah but...But it was still a good experience to train as in, people from different schools coming together for two years and then went to university and er, of course [laughs] er, university was okay. The only thing I remember in university was the riots. Because when we went is when they introduced the school fees and all that. So of course when the school fees...Students always go out on the streets, so I remember [laughs] we are in one big xxxxx I think or so. One of the politicians was tied was killed and every time something like that. Students will always go out and riot and, so, I remember those days of rioting and the xxxxx police will come and interview people and take it to sell the things like that. But they were just angry because we had to start paying school fees and the government was stopping to give us, I think they started giving loans and grants and you have to pay and so there was that transition. It was during that time. But it was fine, we just, we’ve finish, we finished well and yeah we all graduated and then after that, soon after I came, I came here.</p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p>Yeah, so.</p>
<p><em>If it’s okay to jump back to your early life, erm, do you have any early memories of may be taking part in sort of traditional festivities like weddings or funerals or anything like that?</em></p>
<p>Funerals, f-funerals I remember was a big, is a big thing with erm, [coughs] with the Luo’s, the- the one erm, many remember was my grandmother’s funeral. Yeah because my, my granddad had fffive wives, he went with polygamies, we’re polygs-. So we lived in a big compound, so I remember when going back to the village with my dad always, we have, you know the way they, Luo homes xxxx. We have the father at the top of the village and then starts with the first son on one-, the right side, I think right or left. Then the second son on the left. Then the third son. Just the way they house, so they all in a circle. So because my f-, granddad had five wives. So the first wife was next to him, then the second wife, they had the third w-. So it was a huge, it was big home state. So when you come in, before you get to your Dad’s house, there’s your grandmother, there’s so many people come to see you and you can go to any house have dinner, have lunch and nobody’s worried about you. Everybody will come to see you, so in the evening, oh women used to cook. Men don’t, don’t, they don’t cook really. [laughs]</p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p>So in the evening each, each house cooks food and then they bring it to the big table for their men. So men would just come. So each house, each wife has to bring some food you cook whether if it’s xxxxxx meat xxxxxx vege-, but each house has to bring food. To the big table. So’d my granddad and my uncles will come and eat and they can criticize which food is good or bad but the women will not eat. Women you just go and eat the leftovers in the kitchen. So the men really had it nice. So but then during the funeral, of course when there’s somebody, takes a few days before everybody come. But because I was young when, when er, [coughs] when she passed away. But I remember during funerals is always, people have to come. There’s a lot of feasting, and there’s a lot of, they have to slaughter cows, people have to eat and, and there’s this er, tradition before. They call it Teru Buro(?) I don’t know if you’ve heard it, Teru Buro(?). So, they say is, when before af-, as soon after the body’s buried, I think they bury before around three o’clock. After the body’s buried, they have to chase the spirit. So, we just after all the buried, as young people we just see all these men dressed in skin and xxxx with spears! Everybody coming with us, terri-, making noise, a noise like they’re chasing this spirit so they just came from nowhere and running across and I found that, you know? Very intr-, interesting. When they say they’re after bo-, they have to, chase this spirit away and then, of course after that then you have to stay for three days you, I think you have to, to stay with the body, until they, it goes for three days. It just feastin’ and you know and all the eating and xxx things, yeah. I mean that is one of the main thing. But of course there were others like if....er if it is a husband who died, the wife, so because by tradition they’ve ha-, uncles or the in-laws have to take care of the xxxx. So that was quite xxxxx. My mum is, is not. So before everything is done, so they have to get, one of the uncles have to take the woman and may be they have to have like a relationship or a physical relationship to say. You know to symbolise that now this person will take care of you. You know after, you know so it’s like his, you don’t feel as if you’ve been left out. So is like if a woman, the husband died the family, uncle whether will keep on looking after them, after the wife. I mean those are the tradition but nowadays, I don’t think we’ll do that.</p>
<p><em>Does that not happen very often then anymore?</em></p>
<p>No it not, no it’s, not now. Not so much.</p>
<p><em>When did you notice that, that those so-, ty-, sort of traditions started to change? Do you feel?</em></p>
<p>Well I think with my mum, I, is more when they become more Christian, so now my mum goes to church of England. So you know when they, I, with a lot of Christianity. Er so they don’t want to mix with tradition. So, even when my, my dad passed away we didn’t have to do those traditions. But I remember with my un-, auntie she had to do that. So, I think it’s with the coming of Christ-, Christianity so ...right now with my generation I don’t think. My mum also, some are still doing it but most are just not, not doing such. Yeah not a lot, so we just. Is more of a Christian, you just bury and stay at the grave. No I just pray normally and yeah and that’s it.</p>
<p><em>How d-, how do you feel about that? ‘cause obviously from your description of it, it sounded like quite a wonderful spectacle really so....</em></p>
<p>It yeah, it was, but the-, unfortunately, you know because on Thursday we have the old people who kept their tradition, and you know tradition is passed through story. We used to get a lot of stories from my Grandma when you go to the village they used to tell us so many stories and, and there’s a way in which you start story and how you end a story because if you don’t end that there’s xxxxxxxxxxxxx. They have to always finish a story like that. ’Cause if you don’t say this they say that you’ll have a bad dream, a nightmare, but you see with us our, our mum didn’t te-, they told us but kind of if lost it we didn’t take it from them and we’re not telling it to our children, so it is, it is getting lost which is, which is really sad.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>You know and also, with the economy people tend to move to the city looking for jobs. People want to move on, so when they go to the city and leave the village, they meet other tribes ah their traditions and, so they tend to forget their traditions and think their traditions are not important and so that’s how, slowly’s just, it’s just disappearing. They’re no practising it any more.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Or they get married to other traditions, other tribes and they take over those tribes or other people will say your tribes are not good and you know? So they start comparing and then you start thinking no may be my tradition is not good. So either they stay on their Christian or they adopt the modern, the modern culture. Yeah so....i think is just, by opening up and going to the city and having inter marriage. So it’s just dying</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s a real shame isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I know it is.</p>
<p><em>And d’you, d’you remember any other kind of particular traditions that you would have experienced as a child that may be aren’t around so much anymore? Like, erm, was there a certain way a wedding ceremony was held for example or?</em></p>
<p>Erm, yeah. Yeah peri-, for-, I know those of quite a bit, you know like for women had to, this left the teeth, you know the Luo tradition they had to remove the sixth teeth</p>
<p>Ok,</p>
<p>Spesh</p>
<p><em>could you tell me a little bit about that if that’s ok</em></p>
<p>yeah, it used to be women at a certain age, I think when they puberty or something there is six, I dunno why six. But the six lower teeth had to be removed. They used to say it makes them beautiful, or something [laughs]. So, if it was beautiful or it just shows the endurance, cos having your teeth removed is really…I think it’s those traditions that you can endure such pain and you’re not mature enough. Yeah but I used to ask my grandma, I mean why that was done? But when they eat or maybe it’s because they can’t eat, women you can only eat the heads, you know the foods that are not so the legs or maybe it stopped women from eating certain food or for men. Cos when your teeth is removed you can’t eat meat as such, it then becomes difficult, you just have to chew. So maybe it was to discourage women from eating certain types of meat, xxx but they said it was for beauty, so those are some of the things xxxx, I’m quite glad I didn’t have to go through it [laughs]. Because, I mean once that teeth are removed, you know, it becomes difficult. And also for marriage, I think that was long during the marriage- there was the tradition where before you get married, errm it’s kind of the…your fiancé have to come to your home at night and take you, or kidnap you, or something like that. It was more like a victory for the men, the women’s mum was there, so they’d come at night, kidnap, your parents don’t know where you are and you know until they come in and pay dowry, cos dowry is paid to the woman, so the man has to pay the cows, the number of cows, it’s mainly cows. So</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>So they have to pay the cows and the girl’s family have to accept before the girl is released. Some of those are good, because it’s like the value of the girl, you have to because you’re going to leave your family to be with- so they really have to pay something for you. Of course the kidnapping part I don’t like but I still like that one, that still happens now but not so much. Now there is just money. Yeah but they have to pay the dowry, before you actually get married, you can officially say your somebody’s husband. Yeah so those are some of the things, which, which is still be there.</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>Otherwise we just get married nowadays and the parents have to consent, you know before they have to come to the girls and they have to see the family, they have to know the family, they have to check the background, are they witchdoctors, are they good people, are they bad people, before they consent. There’s no way you can just marry anybody. And of course we can’t marry relatives, so they have to make sure there’s no blood relationship and if there is some, any slight relationship or then you can’t, you can’t get married.</p>
<p><em>Ok.</em></p>
<p>Which is good. Because nowadays you can just meet anybody and get married, later you realise you’re related or same family, or you don’t know the family background, which I thought was really good because you just know the person, but you don’t know the family history. And some of these things comes and affects, affects your so…</p>
<p><em>That’s really interesting. Do, do you think life in the city was very different from life in your grandfather’s village then?</em></p>
<p>Well yeah very different, I think if you lived life better, I should think so [coughs]. Because it’s peaceful, because they have these big xxxx, they have farms, it’s the xxxx you know, there’s vegetables. There’s always food, you can go to the garden to get food, go to the river, we all go take bath in the river, there’s section for men, for women, don’t really have showers at home. We just all go to the river, have it with the antelope and together, take the same river, you get the water, you take it home…surprisingly we didn’t get so much sick [<em>laughs</em>], with all the water. It was, it was really good because there’s family there, grandma or ma cook the food and people tend to eat together, you know as a community and you’re free to go to anybody’s house, you know to eat, with no worry. But in the village, I mean in the city, you have to be careful, you can’t just be out at any time, once it’s dark that’s it. In the village, the only problem is the wild animals, that’s, that’s the things, at a certain time if you have to go out but kind of they don’t attack people so much, cos when people have lived in the village with them, they know, they just coming to get the animals not people. But that’s the only thing you’ll be scared of [<em>laughs</em>], you know being attacked by hyenas mainly, hyenas are the main ones, or being bitten by a snake. But I never got bitten or anything, you know so it was, I find the village was really…and it was peaceful, at night it was really peaceful, you have clean air, you know, errr good atmosphere, there’s not so much of this xxxx, so it quite soothing and errm living it was good, the village is too polluted, yeah too many cars and we walk a lot cos there’s no vehicles, so we walk to the market, walk back to the river, walk to the doctors, there’s not really many traditional doctors, so we used to use a lot of herbs, yeah just normal herbs boil them if you have a stomach ache, drink and the sickness goes.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember a particular remedy maybe that you know, you either took or you saw being made and what was in it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Errm I can’t remember but we used bitter, this was for upset stomach, I can’t remember the herbs but we used to have that. The mum used to boil them for a long time, the leaves are brown and then we’d drink the water, the water was very bitter, at least everybody was supposed to drink a cup. And it was very good for indigestion, so after you, everything just comes out, it’s just like a detox, so you all go toilet and your stomach is clean, it’s like detox, it removes everything. You know, so if you have a stomach ache, which just had that, have boiled, you drink it, it’s very bitter though but afterward you’re fine. And one which I tell you, is what I tell you is what we call, they call it afita, afita. So it’s like, some use tobacco leaves, is you put in your nose and it makes you sneeze, so it makes the nose itchy, I don’t know what it is but if you have a blocked nose, you sneeze it and you just, you just sneeze, sneeze until your head is clear and that was good, we used to have it every month and mum all children and the whole house, we had tissues and hankies and everybody sneeze everything out, which was good, so after that, like now if my daughter is so decongested, like now they take all this inhaler but still it doesn’t come but that just take everything out. So that is something that I still remember, those two. And they really worked, they were really useful and I wish as a mum now, I’d really like to, when the children have blocked nose, give them that, sneeze it all out and they’re fine.</p>
<p><em>Can you not get that over here then?</em></p>
<p>No I can but only, I don’t think I can. Only when you get home, then I can get some but here, I don’t know, I haven’t checked, maybe, I haven’t checked if I can get it but it’s very good.</p>
<p><em>And when you were growing up, how aware of you, were you of the political situation in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>Well, I was aware because I’m a Luo, my father was very strong ok and the ruling party was mainly Kenyatta, it was Kukuo and Luos and Kukuos do not go together [laughs], of course with my dad would always say everything against the Kukuos and the President and there was xxxx at that time and want and then the Kukuos were always the Luos. So growing up we were really aware about the tribal issues, especially the Luos and Kukos were great enemies. My dad even swore never marry a Kukuo in your life, there’s no way, you know [laughs], there’s no way you can. So because of politics it also came to other aspects of life, we are great enemies even in school, my dad used to tell me ‘A Kukuo should never beat you, you should always beat them in class’ you know, ‘you’re better than them.’ So we’re really not but that tension political was there, also when Moi came in, there’s a lot of, the problem with Kenya is there’s a lot of tribalism, so when he came there was too much, too obvious, cos my university was in Eldoret, which is more of Kalenjin area and I had many friends who were Kukuos, who are staying in the Kalenjin area and it was during that time we had the Majimbo and the Kukuos were being chased out of the Kalenjin, because they are saying it’s not their land, because during Kenyatta they got their land but now because Moi is the President, he wants the Kukuos out. So many lost their houses, their houses were burnt and had to be chased and it was obvious when the Kalenjin get, the President who is in power, their people get the priorities, get whatever, so it was just too obvious [laughs]. Yeah you can see, so if you’re not in power, you’re marginalised, you know you don’t get anything. So this one was really bad, it was obvious you know, so it just, it goes so whatever comes next to power, you know their people will get what they want, the rest, you know even from a young age it was something…</p>
<p><em>And in terms obviously, you know you say whoever’s in power, the other tribes felt marginalised for that reason, how obvious was that, in what ways was that demonstrated?</em></p>
<p>Jobs.</p>
<p><em>Jobs.</em></p>
<p>If you’re going to look for jobs, if you’re the xxxx xxxx, you will get the jobs and that’s the main thing, you need a job to survive. You know, so getting the big positions, especially in government offices they will have all the big positions, so the other tribes, either they get the small positions or you really don’t get, you don’t get a job. Even in schools the headmistress or the top heads will be from that tribe, yeah we can see it, at my school my headmistress, one was a teacher but the next thing she was the headmistress of another school, just because she’s from the same tribe, so promotions could happen so drastic and it’s just too obvious, you know? Yeah so those people were not from that tribe which was ruling, you just, you have to work so hard to get anywhere. Or even if you want to get something from the government, like either papers or loan or money it becomes so difficult.</p>
<p><em>How did that make you feel?</em></p>
<p>Well of course it makes you angry at times and it brings hatred and there’s a lot more tribalism, so, so growing up because seeing it from my father, hating especially Kukuos who that time were in power, you also ended up growing up hating them and you think ‘Oh we’ll never be together, they’re different they have all this, we don’t have this.’ And it is there’s and we become separate in the same country but we can’t do things together and it comes living here it still happens up to now, it hasn’t changed you know.</p>
<p><em>Do you mean it happens here in the UK as well?</em></p>
<p>Even in the UK, we have Luos and Kukuos and we hardly do much together, you know? So even in the embassy it might be Kukuo, it might be..tend to be the same tribe in one [coughs], in one ministry. And another tribe in another, so people working together I don’t know how it’s working now, xxxx is very difficult for Kenyan and that is something they have to work on, that tribalism things, it’s just avoiding development really, yeah.</p>
<p><em>So when did you move to the UK then? How old were you?</em></p>
<p>Xxxx ’96, I was twenty- six, yeah.</p>
<p><em>And what were your first impressions of the UK?</em></p>
<p>Well, what do they say, it was cold. [both laugh] I came in January so...[laughs]</p>
<p><em>Mistake</em> [<em>laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Yeah it was cold, it was busy. But one thing I would say, it was organised, you know? Because there’s signs everywhere, if you can’t speak English, because when I came I had a tube map and then you had to go somewhere in Lancaster Gate, so just that and I go there cos from Victoria or wherever cos I came through Europe. I mean from Victoria Station, you got to the tube and this is where you are going and I go there. So there’s that thing, that is organised you, you can read, you can see, it was sort of a xxxx, there’s so much light, they’re so many, you know? There’s so oh everything, it’s just and so it’s so clean, it’s so nice it’s beautiful, you know? Nice things compared to, uh what you have there really. I found everything was quite neat, organised, you know? And people, people are just disciplined, you know? There’s no chaos, there’s no chaos. In Africa there’s a lot of chaos, people are moving here and they’re not. But here everything is in time you have to do this and everybody knows what they’re supposed to be doing, you know?</p>
<p><em>Can I ask why you decided to come to the UK?</em></p>
<p>It was just to continue my studies really.</p>
<p><em>Ok.</em></p>
<p>Cos I wanted to carry on into a Masters, so that was the main thing.</p>
<p><em>And did you achieve that here?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah I did.</p>
<p><em>Where did you go, if you don’t mind me asking?</em></p>
<p>I came, I did my marketing at the Chartered Institute of Marketing and then I did an MBA in err in Greenwich school of Management, for the university of xxxx, yeah so that’s what I did.</p>
<p><em>Good for you.</em> [<em>laughs</em>]</p>
<p>Hmm. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>And you said, did you get married here or did you go to Kenya to get married?</em></p>
<p>No here, here. My husband is not Kenyan, he was in Europe, that’s why I came to Europe, he’s from Mongolia but he was in Czech Republic so, so he came here and then we just got married here.</p>
<p><em>And what kind of ceremony did you have, did you have a traditional one? </em></p>
<p>Oh no we just had registrar.</p>
<p><em>Ok.</em></p>
<p>[laughs] But err but three, four years ago we went back home and just to meet the parents and is yet to take the normal tradition, he has to take the cows, you know he has to still go home and buy errm and you know with the tradition you have to go buy a cow and walk it to the village, you can’t just say, you have to walk with it from the market. [both laugh] So he’s yet to do that and he can’t just, or he can just send one of my brothers to buy and take it to the village. So he’s gone, the first time you go you have to go home and ask for, what you cannot ask for hand in marriage is called ayeah? So you went home to give something to my mother, you know to say I have you daughter and give some money as a symbol, just to say we have agreed you can have the daughter. But he has not given the dowry which is a big thing, which should be given to my dad and that is a cow, two or three so he’s yet to do that, he has to go and walk a cow to the village [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p><em>Is he looking forward to that?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Good</em> [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p>Before he does that, they don’t consider me married, you know they don’t consider all this...you know/</p>
<p><em>And do you think it’s difficult maintaining sort of traditional practices and errm, I don’t know traditional sort of lifestyle in the UK or do you find that your community, the Luo community in the UK does band together to hold that?</em></p>
<p>For me, I find it very difficult, you know? That is something that is like, yeah we’re overwhelmed, you know? When you come you have bills, you have family, you have to go to work, some have to go to school, so that just takes over, it’s like for example right now I’m a teacher at a college, so that just takes over, you know? They have from Monday to Friday, weekends you have the children, you know you have all the other housework. So of course I’d really love to have things like this but it’s just the time, you know. Some of us work err my husband works night shifts, you know because when you’re there, you work night shifts or day shifts, so we don’t have that, so it becomes difficult for people to come together and do this things, you know really it would be nice if, if they could do it.</p>
<p><em>Is that why you enjoy events like this evening?</em></p>
<p>Yes I did in fact for my children because they miss a lot, especially stories, cos when I went to Kenya I bought so many stories err but you can just read them, you know. Somebody speaking them and telling you, is much better than you reading it.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t make...so I really want them to here these things and I want them...even the one before for drumming, my daughters enjoyed the drumming cos they like, in their school they do African drumming, they like to do African dance because they have to, otherwise they will forget it. Because otherwise it’s just telly, so they don’t know anything so...something like this is really good for them.</p>
<p><em>What kind of stories do you mean? Are they kind of, are they kind of like fables or..?</em></p>
<p>Yeah fables yeah, I bought a lot of fable books. Maybe why the hyena or why the crow crows at night and why the chicken, you know those kind of stories, so those are the ones I bought. Cos they were the ones we used to be told, why so and so xxxx, the stupid girl or the clever girl, or didn’t do this or didn’t listen to their parents or went to the forest, you know? Yeah...</p>
<p><em>It sounds amazing. It sounds like a lot of fun. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah it is.</p>
<p><em>And is there anything else about your life or the traditions of the Luo people that you’d like to be recorded? Anything other than what we’ve talked about? If you’d like to add anything about yourself or your family?</em></p>
<p>Hmm...I don’t think there’s anything [<em>laughs</em>]. But I think some of the traditions, most of us we didn’t understand them you know? We used to think maybe our parents or our grandparents were really crazy or primitive, why do they do these things? For example having the [coughs] cooking you know? Before you’re married you need the three stones to cook with the house in the fire, you know? But really they had meanings behind it, there’s the stability, it brings warmth but we didn’t know the reason, we just used to think they do this they do these things. And I think it would be very important, if maybe we sat with them and they told us, cos I’m sure them they also learnt it from generations to know why they do them, cos once we understand the reason why they do them and the reason why they lasted for so long, they must, they must be a reason, they must be valuable. Yeah cos once we lose this tradition we are falling apart you know? We’re not so stable as them, our families are not stable, we are all over the place. But our parents used to be stable, even with the polygamy family, this was polygamy but it was all united, it was all stable. We didn’t have maybe single parents, you know that’s one thing cos they’d always be somebody to take, to take care of you. We didn’t have so many orphans because there’s a family, you can say my mum, my dad because there’s a family for you.</p>
<p><em>Hmm</em></p>
<p>Now if your mum is not there, your dad is not there it’s either care or somebody else. But that one was, the family was always there, your extended family is your family.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And that is something here we really miss and generally you’re happy, you don’t feel lonely but in this life we tend to be so isolated, it’s just your family; your husband, wife, mum, what is it called? Nuclear family. So and then there’s a nuclear family, nuclear family is so isolated and it can be so lonely and that is one thing that I miss, that family that extended family tradition. And I think that is something we should work on.</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>And keep it yeah.</p>
<p><em>Are you keen to teach your own children then about the traditions and the culture to make sure it carries on?</em></p>
<p>Yeah , yeah definitely. The tradition, the language, I’m starting to teach them the language, you know? They have to know the language is very important, you know at least a few words, they have to know that and a few of the traditions of what we used to do or if something xxxx...yeah.</p>
<p><em>Fantastic. Thank you very, very much.</em></p>
<p>Ok thank you.</p>
<p><em>I’ll just stop that.</em></p>
