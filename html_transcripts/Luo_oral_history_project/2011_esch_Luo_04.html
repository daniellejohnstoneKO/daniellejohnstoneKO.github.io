<p><em>Ok, can I ask you to say your full name and date of birth please. </em></p>
<p>Oh my name is Charles Lutimo(?) Akudo</p>
<p><em>Could you spell your surname for me please.</em></p>
<p>A-K-U-D-O</p>
<p><em>And your date of birth please?</em></p>
<p>20<sup>th</sup> June 1963.</p>
<p><em>Brilliant, and can I ask where you were born please. </em></p>
<p>I was born in Kenya in Nairobi.</p>
<p><em>Nairobi</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>That’s quite a large city isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>What was it like living in a large city?</em></p>
<p>Mmmm it was challenging, though interesting and very adventurous</p>
<p><em>Yeah, and what did your parents do for work? </em></p>
<p>Er, my dad was an accountant and my mum was a sales girl.</p>
<p><em>Okay, and did you have any brothers or sisters?</em></p>
<p>Yeah I’ve got two brothers and three sisters.</p>
<p><em>Wow, large family.</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>And erm, w-what did you do, er what school did you go to when you were growing up?</em></p>
<p>I schooled in Nairobi</p>
<p><em>Yeah </em></p>
<p>In Government Road Primary which is now Moy Avenue Primary.</p>
<p><em>And what was that like? Do you have any sort of enduring memories of your school days.</em></p>
<p>Mmmm yeah it was fun you know, it was very competitive. We enjoyed going to school, a school with all my siblings in the same school.</p>
<p><em>Mmm, okay and erm, in terms of your, your dad’s position as an accountant, erm would he have had to go to erm school or university or anything to have done that?</em></p>
<p>He did not sss, he did not do much of formal education but he did professional examinations much later.</p>
<p><em>Right ok</em></p>
<p>To erm better himself, hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Fantastic, and, and what was it like growing up erm, in, in the sort of late sixties and early seventies in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>Mmmm, life was easy.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Most things were....., most essentials were available. And it was adventurous, it was, it was not hazardous as I see today.</p>
<p><em>Wh-what do you think of it is about these times today that er, are harder than they were for you, do you think?</em></p>
<p>I think now there are more people, there’s more competition and the resources are fewer.</p>
<p><em>And in terms of the Luo community, erm, how, how much a part of that community was it, was it quite an obvious situation to be in that you were part of that community or?</em></p>
<p>Er, to begin with, my dad was a chairman of the Luo community from where I come from called, called query(?)</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>In Nairobi, he was a chairman for many years, and that projects like building schools, because they realize one of their main project was Nyakongo(?) Girls, because they suddenly they realise that there are no girl schools where we came from, so then back on one end. I actually it was quite successful</p>
<p><em>Fantastic. And can you remember any sort of big occasions as a child where you would have been exposed too sort of traditional weddings or funerals or anything like that?</em></p>
<p>Er, actually I come from a Christian family so most of the weddings have been Christian, but we used to, every, every, every long school holidays we used to go back up country, to the reserve and we reside there for the entire period until come back when schools are open.</p>
<p><em>Could, could you describe that experience of going to the reserves in the holidays?</em></p>
<p>The beginning it is a shock, because my Dad only had a hut. He had not built a house. He only had a hut. So, we found it a bit, and then we ..... we had to go and do a bit of farming, which was done manually. And it was actually an ex-, quite an experience because it’s something we are not exposed to before.</p>
<p><em>Um, c-could you describe um, maybe like you said it was quite a traditional way of farming, erm, could you describe in what way it was like that?</em></p>
<p>It was traditional in the sense like, they would laid traps for ants. To feed the chicken. And we used holes and you know? Holes and machetes to dig.</p>
<p><em>So it was physically quite hard.</em></p>
<p>Physically it was quite involving, physically.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>Would you come back from, er, er day exhausted do you think?</em></p>
<p>I was young then, so I had all the energy [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Could have done it all night! [laughs]</em></p>
<p>Could have done it all night but may be today I would ss, I probably can’t do it now [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] was it quite a long day then? What’s the time in the morning would you start?</em></p>
<p>You would start fr-, very early because normally you f-, you will leave the farms when the sun starts scorching</p>
<p><em>Okay, so you would finish sort of a-about lunch time normally.</em></p>
<p>By about lunch time would be leaving it</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>Because then it should be very hot, because Kenya’s quite a hot country</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] compared to the UK definitely, um, and, and what other things would you do when you’re on the reserve over that summer, would, would you erm, I don’t know see relatives or?</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah we used to visit relatives we introduced to our relatives and sometimes we do walk to the lake because I come from the shores of the lake and we try and swim though we are really questioned about swimming the lake because of crocodiles.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p><em>Did you ever see any crocodiles?</em></p>
<p>I did not see any but I had occasions where people have got eaten. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Was that quite common?</em></p>
<p>Huh</p>
<p><em>Was it quite common that, that would happen? </em></p>
<p>It’s very rare but it happens, it’s very rare but it happens because you’re not, people try to go for and get water early in the morning. And that’s when they get caught</p>
<p><em>And, and did you ever go fishing on the lake yourself? </em></p>
<p>No I’ve never done fishing because u see we don’t fish with rods there. They have to use a boat and actually fishing is quite restricted only to fishermen, licensed fishermen.</p>
<p><em>Do you know if it’s quite difficult for those fishermen to get the licence to fish on the lake or?</em></p>
<p>I don’t think it’s quite difficult for them because there are many of them, it’s doing it and in the morning they come back with a lot of fishing.</p>
<p><em>And, and, and during that time when you were out in the country rather than in the city, would you see more traditional practices of the Luo people do you think? Like erm, like if, you know the funerals, traditional funerals or?</em></p>
<p>Yeah I would s-, I’ve, I’ve attended quite a few, a number of funerals and ss, the, this was a xxxxx traditions, like the chasing of the cows across the village. It’s they, they regard that as bring the cows to mourn the person who has departed [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>If it is a xxxx person, so they’d be running across a village, the cows, and then they would drive to this pier, like they're coming to attack you and just stop right in front of you and then run across again to the other direction. So if you’re not quite familiar with that, you would get scared. But since we knew they were not going to harm anybody, we would just watch it and laugh it off.</p>
<p><em>Was it quite exciting to see that kind of, display as a boy do you think?</em></p>
<p>It was exciting because actually their, the first they put is it’s interesting because they don’t really mean what they’re doing but [laughs] they somehow manage to do it.</p>
<p><em>Could, could you describe what erm, the traditional dress that they would wear or?</em></p>
<p>Mmmmmm actually but in my generation we were not about to see any traditional dresses because people just dress normally. Traditional dresses were discarded mainly as before we xxxx</p>
<p><em>Okay. So, so no one would wear sort of traditional clothing, they would just have like the spear, like you say</em></p>
<p>They just be dressed but they have a spear</p>
<p><em>Okay, fantastic, and erm, b-, in c-, in comparison to the, the life in the country and the life in the city would you say that you had a preference for either? And if s-, if, if you do, which, which one, do, do you think you would prefer and why?</em></p>
<p>I prefer the town, there’s more hardship in the p-, and to because even things like.....things like electricity and water</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>They would just xxxxx come there</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p><em>So it, it was a better standard of living do you think in the city?</em></p>
<p>The, the city’s got better standard of living.</p>
<p><em>Okay. You mention that when you first started going to the reserve in the summer holidays that y-your father had a hut. But I don’t suppose you could describe that s-, or erm the experience of living in it would you?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it was. It was a round hut, it was divided in to three. One section was like the living room, and one would be the kitchen and the other one would be the bedroom. And it was actually grass thatch [laughs] mmmmmm</p>
<p><em>And, and s-, what was it like living in, it was it, was it, did it feel quite close quarters, considering there were, you know quite, quite a, alot of you sleeping in one room. Was that quite difficult or?</em></p>
<p>We didn’t ss, we didn’t regard it as difficult then. Because we didn’t know of any other [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>Because even in the city we actually managed to get space when we were a bit older. But when we were young, it was ....</p>
<p><em>So you would have shared bedrooms and things before anyway?</em></p>
<p>You never share beds.</p>
<p>Y<em>eah</em></p>
<p>We shared beds</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>We’d share mattresses on the floor [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Fantastic. So, so what did you do when you left school? </em></p>
<p>What me?</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>I.....pursued accounts like my dad.</p>
<p><em>And, and did you </em></p>
<p>And I worked with a Kenya T Development.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>For about eight years, before I came to this country.</p>
<p><em>Could you describe that experience of working? Like what was it-what’s it like? Did you enjoy the work, was it quite....</em></p>
<p>I didn’t enjoy the work, because the pay was low [laughs]</p>
<p><em>You think you would’ve enjoyed it more if you got paid </em></p>
<p>But I would have enjoyed more if we got paid better, hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Okay. Why was it quite poorly paid? Was it poorly paid in comparison.....</em></p>
<p>Because of the standards. Hmmm [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Okay [laughs]. And in terms of politics in the country when you were growing up is there anything that sort of stands out in your mind is, erm having an impact on you, and lifestyle and your family?</em></p>
<p>Of course we used to see a lot of political assassinations and you have things like. It was ah one party system where not all are allowed to participate in politics. Hmmm. It was a bit oppressive.</p>
<p><em>Do you think your parents found that difficult? Living un-under that system?</em></p>
<p>My parents were open to positions and er, I don’t think they found it difficult because they didn’t know of any other [laughs]. You see I mean with politics, when you get educated about your rights and you get enlightened then you get to know that you’re being oppressed. But before that life is just normal because you don’t know of any other way of life.</p>
<p><em>So was that that the attitude that you had, do you think, when you were, when you first started working? Were you....?</em></p>
<p>When I first started working I also thought that was the norm</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>But as we grew and you know? Read more, then we realise that we are being suppressed.</p>
<p><em>And how did that make you feel? Do you think?</em></p>
<p>Of course it feels depressed but you know out there in the sunshine actually, people don’t get actually really depressed [laughs]. We just get upset about it and get xxxxx. Hmmmm.</p>
<p><em>And, and wer- d-, were there any erm, sort of rallies or things like that? Erm, that you were aware of? That were taking place or was that also suppressed?</em></p>
<p>Those came much later, when I was older. Those came in the nineties, when people started j-, revolting against the system.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>And their system started opening up and changing and they started creating more democratic space.</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>Up to where we are now. But we have free and fare elections hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Fantastic. And, and when did you move to the UK then? </em></p>
<p>I came to the UK in 1995.</p>
<p><em>’95</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>And what were your reasons for coming to the UK? At that time?</em></p>
<p>A better life. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] In what way were you expecting a better life? </em></p>
<p>I knew standards here were higher than in Kenya. Hmm, so I knew that life would be better here. Hmm</p>
<p><em>And, and what were your first impressions of the UK?</em></p>
<p>I was actually quite impressed because I saw development of the standards that are not realise are achievable.</p>
<p><em>Okay. And, and what in particular do you think was the kind of most noticeable difference between life in the UK and life in Kenya for you do you think?</em></p>
<p>Here the system works</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p><em>C-could you expand on that a little bit? If that’s okay?</em></p>
<p>I mean you pay taxes, roads are built, there’s electricity, there’s water</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>And everybody’s entitled to it. And you know, you pay things and get the services.</p>
<p><em>Do-, d’you think the rural communities in Kenya didn’t see that so much as, erm, may be in the cities. Like you say you know you had like electricity and things in the cities but they didn’t in the countryside. Do you think that was bi-, big for that reason? That you know taxes were paid but they weren’t filtered through enough?</em></p>
<p>No there the system simply doesn’t work.</p>
<p><em>Right okay [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] it doesn’t work, you have to pay the bills and pay more to get better services. [laughs]</p>
<p><em>And, and what about things like erm, I don’t know erm, fa-, favourite food or things like that, wh-, did you find that quite difficult to get in the UK at first or?</em></p>
<p>Initially it was quite difficult, but as the numbers increased I think the market opened up. Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>And, and can you think of any sort of erm traditional meals from your childhood that you try to recreate over here now or? Any particular dishes and... </em></p>
<p>I tell you sooner or later more-more, most of them are available because like, eating the tilapia fish, you know the tilapia?</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Yeah and things like eating, what do you call it?.......hmmm, the insides?</p>
<p><em>Erm, offal</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>Like offal, do you mean?</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>You know those ones are not available but these days you can get them.</p>
<p><em>And, and do you think that’s, that’s a good thing that it’s kind of more, more international now and that you can. </em></p>
<p>I think it’s a good thing because even, by the time I came to this country things like crisps, they used to scrap all the meat and throw the bones. But to see where we come from we enjoy ripping the meat out of the bone yourself [laughs]. So by the time we started buying them, actually, the-, they were, even selling them for a pound, but now you just buy it like meat because of the demand.</p>
<p><em>So th-, the, the sort of erm, as, as the Luo community got bis-, bigger in this country, your saying that the market sort of responded to that and the desires ....</em></p>
<p>The markets responded to that because, you see most of Africans there’s closeness in similarities of what they eat so, they get things like, cow foot and things like that. Now you get them and you know? And you get west Africans eating it and this xxxx eating it.</p>
<p><em>And erm, how, how do you feel the, may be erm, traditional values that you grew up with a boy. How-ha- do you find them difficult to maintain in the UK or? Do you think that the community is strong enough to sort of perpetuate their own heritage and things like that?</em></p>
<p>I don’t find any difficulties because it’s just by choice hmmm the way you live is by choice. Yes, hmm.</p>
<p><em>Do you think you have a close knit community here in the UK?</em></p>
<p>Of course we do yeah.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>We do because that’s the only [coughs] that’s the only thing you lean back to.</p>
<p><em>And how is it in comparison to like, like I said when, when you were growing up as a boy? Do you think that it’s the kind of lifestyle and the people that you know are, are similar? And it’s just been transferred really, overseas or?</em></p>
<p>No, of course society changes. A lot has changed and people don’t want to bring up their kids, there are brought up [laughing]. So really there’s nothing really there to hold on to.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. </em></p>
<p>You know things change and kids are become more independent, they like to choose the way the-, they would like to be brought up.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm, I interviewed someone earlier. And erm, he said that erm, even today, erm, people in this country when, when it comes to a time to get married, they will still consult elders and things like that. Are you aware of anything like that? Do you think?</em></p>
<p>Er, I think they must distinguish between consulting and consent</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Because it’s not actually consul they look for, they just consult to inform them of what things is going on. So, I think that is quite an honour because it’s family, you have to let them know, what is happening in your life.</p>
<p><em>Yes. And is there anything about your time growing up in Kenya and obviously the years that you worked there, that you would like to be recorded that are reflective of your life or the history and culture of your people?</em></p>
<p>Actually I’ve not been quite culturally brought up because I’m brought up in the town.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>So really I’ve nothing to cling on to [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Okay.</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>Is there anything else you would like to say for the tape? Or were you okay? </em></p>
<p>No I think I am okay, with all I said.</p>
<p><em>Okay, brilliant. Thank you very much.</em></p>
<p>Oh thank you.</p>
<p><em>Just stop that </em></p>
