<p><em>Okay so that’s recording now, can I ask you to say your full name and date of birth please?</em></p>
<p>My name is Felix Omanje my date of birth is 21<sup>st</sup> of August nineteen seventy one.</p>
<p><em>And can I ask you to spell your surname please?</em></p>
<p>OMANJE.</p>
<p><em>And can I ask where you were born?</em></p>
<p>I was born in a place called Nairobi, is in Kenya.</p>
<p><em>And can I ask what your parents did for work?</em></p>
<p>Actually my Dad, my Dad was a surveyor and my Mum was a nursery school teacher.</p>
<p><em>And that was both in Nairobi as well?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>Okay, and what was it like growing up in the city?</em></p>
<p>A mix of both really because we had a normal African setting, we had fun time, we had school time, we had family time, so it was all round I think, it was quite nice.</p>
<p><em>Could you tell me what schools you went to in Nairobi?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to one school called St Mary’s, I went to another one called Muslim Primary that was in my xxxx education, I think they are the only two actually and my xxxx was called Nairobi Primary, both in Nairobi yes.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything about your school days that you particularly remember that particularly stands out in your mind?</em></p>
<p>Apart from the discipline I had this one teacher who was called Elizabeth she was so bad, well not bad, she was so straight and you had to be there on time, you had to finish your homework and she could take you back to your parents and just sit you down and give you a wallop in front of your parents if you don’t do anything right or if you do something wrong at school, she was that strict, I remember that today, yes.</p>
<p><em>I’m sure that would be something that stays with you doesn’t it.</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes, and you know as you grow up and now you look back and you say oh she was absolutely doing this for our good and look how we turned out. I passed my examinations; I want my kids to go to the same school so they get the same discipline. It’s cruel if you look at it in a modern world but it works, it works yes.</p>
<p><em>Fantastic and growing up did you have any brothers or sisters?</em></p>
<p>I had one brother, my younger brother.</p>
<p><em>That’s quite a small family compared to some of the people I’ve spoken to isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes, this is, my Dad passed away in I think nineteen seventy six and that was it, my Mum never got remarried so we were only two so that was it.</p>
<p><em>I’m sorry to hear about your Father, I’m sorry about that.</em></p>
<p>That’s okay.</p>
<p><em>And how aware were you when you were growing up of your traditional community sort of traditions for the Luo community?</em></p>
<p>We were, in Nairobi there’s that setting of xxxx people always meeting somewhere or in a like a relative’s home, there’s this visit that goes round, we can be in your house today, next weekend we are in somebody else’s house, your cousin’s house. So we actually mingled together with other people and we meet other tribes as well who come in and just have fun like we did last week, everybody just coming in and food and drinks and then you go back home and that’s it. And we were told that this was to bring up kids, to bring us up knowing who we are so that you don’t get too attached to your xxxx which was right.</p>
<p><em>Do you think it was more difficult maintaining those traditions in the city than it would have been maybe if you had lived in the countryside?</em></p>
<p>Yes I think so, I think in the city it’s quite different because after that you get all your parents going to work, you get your Mum or your Dad goes to work and then you have that xxxx of being alone or doing whatever you want to do after that, but back home in the countryside there is always somebody, there is always a nanny or somebody who is living with nanny who is just looking after kids, yes, there’s not much freedom there [laugh], apart from xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Did you use to visit the countryside quite a lot; did you have relatives out in the countryside?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes we use to go and see, because my Mum had a, some of her sisters and brothers back in the countryside so, and on Christmas we would all go back home and have a get together party and Grannies, all the great, great Grannies, yes so we get to meet the lot.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything in particular about maybe your Grandparents for example would they try to, because I’ve heard the xxxx community has a really strong tradition of storytelling, is that something you would have picked up from your Grandparents or was that something you weren’t so familiar with as much?</em></p>
<p>I think I must have picked that up from my Grandpa from my Mum’s side, he worked, he use to tell me this story that he worked for the British Colonial, what were they called, was he a home guard or something like that, it was a security for them and actually he was one of the first people who went on top of Mount Kilimanjaro, I had a picture of him on Mount Kilimanjaro, I’ll try and get it for you someday. He use to tell us a lot of stories of how he lived, he was a xxxx, and speaks very good English and he passed away early this year in February, God bless him. So yes we use to have a lot of stories of how the British come in and how they use to take care of the people and scholarship and all the things so yes.</p>
<p><em>So he was quite positive about the British experience?</em></p>
<p>Yes he was, he was, he said many people didn’t, later he realised that many of the home guards that were being marginalised because they worked for the British Colonial Security or whatever they were called those days, they had a name, so when the government took over they were sort of sacked and he got job at the Kenya Police Forces but he said got demoted, or thinks, you know how it goes, because he was not part of the thing, yes so that was it.</p>
<p><em>Obviously that brings in quite a lot of politics at the time in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes, there was, Kenya was a very young country then but you can imagine this was in the sixties, you can imagine they could be singled out and be told that you know you are the British before you are, you are killing your brothers, or your protecting the white people, something like that. so that was a division then and he told me first hand and I really felt bad actually for him and he ended up working for the B A T, British American Tobacco for twenty five years and then he retired to go back home.</p>
<p><em>How aware would you have been do you think of the politics of your country when you were growing up because obviously you weren’t born till the seventies so you know your Grandparents talking about the sixties you probably wouldn’t have remembered things like that so much or would you have later on in the seventies and eighties maybe?</em></p>
<p>Later in the seventies I could still pick up, like I said the other things were really helpful and people would meet up and just the stories flowing from one another. I use to work here somebody in the car industry, it was quite an industrious thing telling stories and letting the young ones know what has happened before and I think it is from there that some of it sunk into my head and it never went because for me this was a firsthand experience because I’m talking to somebody who was like in a war in those days and now he’s still alive, yes that really, really got me.</p>
<p><em>You mentioned briefly a minute ago about how if someone was in charge then other tribes maybe marginalised and sort of pushed to the side lines a little bit, did you ever experience anything like that or see it firsthand because of the political situation?</em></p>
<p>Me as a person?</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Much later yes, <em>it’s still going on up to now xxxx. The current government well they haven’t been there for a while, I’ve been trying to follow up on the news and all those things. The current government is from, basically formed from a tribe called Kikuyu [?] and for a very long time they took over after Kenyatta, Kenyatta was our first President, he was a Kikuyu, and the corporation that bought Kenyatta in was between the Luoes and Alua [?] which is another tribe and Abeta the Massi [?] but eventually the elders agreed to give it to Kenyatta who was a Kikuyu so in the process Kenyatta decided to take everything to their province, sort of like you would say, not abara,</em> like into the abara and it started developing from there to the Province and all the central government everything going to his area to his people xxxx. Then the xxxx people had someone called Okingakinga[?] who was our new elder and he also started this resistance, a quiet one, a soft one within the government and this just picked up and that’s all we knew now when we were growing up, we are Luoes and we would never get anything because we are not in the government and for a very long time there were no roads and until now we had no water, there is no electricity in some parts of Luo xxxx, and education has really gone down, so we don’t get, most of it is what I would call semi arid area, it is very dry, I think about fifty forty per cent of it is very dry, I’m not quite sure about the statistics but it is dry, and if we don’t get funding, I believe there is a xxxx something like that when drought comes in or this other flooding but we don’t get that, yes so.</p>
<p><em>So those kind of things are quite obvious on the day to day life…</em></p>
<p>It is yes, it is still going on now if you still talk to other people who are in the government they still tell you there is a xxxx and they are not fighting their way back to try to put a foot into the government to get more powers in but the other tribes believe the Luoes are very kind of, very strict people, they are not like the Kukuri tribe which is, which we look at, they are people, we look at them like opportunists, grabbers so to say, but the firsthand, the more they get they put things to themselves but they Luoes naturally are people who want to develop everybody around them. If I have something and I’m a Luo I make sure you are comfortable before me then you won’t give me trouble, what I have around me I can have, I can share, but this other tribe are all for themselves and to my understanding that is what has bought all this differences out of the what sixty nine tribes we have in that country, yes, so basically the war is between Luoes and Kikuyu and right now the Massia and all the other tribes are also coming in, everybody wants a xxxx of their own, same has what has happened for the past forty to fifty years it’s all been Kikuyu, yes.</p>
<p><em>So you think that now people are starting to realise that they want a fairer share if you like?</em></p>
<p>Exactly yes.</p>
<p><em>How does that make you feel?</em></p>
<p>Right now it makes me feel like we are still far, far away from democracy and transparency, we are not there yet and it might take a longer time to get there and I feel failed by it because every time every year I see people still vote and they are fighting and killing each other because they are voting for what they won’t get, you take somebody in there and you say alright we are taking you in there you fight for our rights but at the end of the day they end up buying big cars xxxx and people are still suffering around there so it kind of pushes me away from politics, I’ve not been very active towards politics for a very long time and simply it’s because of this tribal factor that people have bought into politics yes.</p>
<p><em>It’s a really fascinating sort of story though isn’t it and it’s always nice to see people fighting for equality so it’s a good thing.</em></p>
<p>I just wish somebody would come up with a proper forum, sort of what are you doing now and go tribe by tribe and just get their views of why the country has come from and where we are going and what difficulties there are and the obstacles in between politics and the social life is it must be quite massive, and up to date that has not been done. This is the first time I think you are getting the real view of what our politics is like in the xxxx.</p>
<p><em>If you had to describe the law of politics in one line what do you think it would be, in one sentence? Is it even possible? [Laugh]</em></p>
<p>Being a Luo that is hard [laugh], because, I want to add one, two or three things. Luo politics would be clean and fair.</p>
<p><em>It’s a really sort of…</em></p>
<p>Yes, and for everyone, it can’t be one [laugh] yes.</p>
<p><em>It’s really interesting. I mentioned to somebody else I interviewed that obviously I done a little bit of research about the community and I noticed that there are quite a lot of, quite prominent Luo people in things like rights, activism and things like that, do you think that’s kind of an extension of the kind of Luo philosophy of the political situation that they have been in that they now feel that they should sort of fight and be rights activists and things like that?</em></p>
<p>Yes that is very true. This activist has always been around ever since from the time of Kenyatta, and some of them are buried just because of trying to fight for this, the Luo forum, what shall I call it, a xxxx for the Luo people just to lift their heads up and say, “Look we are here”, they have been silenced by the government, the two previous regimes have been so secretive shall I say, and if you speak too much, if you say anything that is going to conflict what the President is saying then you would be taken in for some kind of capital punishment, yes, it was actually treason, there’s a clause that says if you go against what the government is you are taken in for life imprisonment yes. So the Luo people have always been there but they were silent, but now they are coming up with the way the xxxx party has just tried to change things up which is still very hard I believe but yes he was right to tell you that, they are coming up yes.</p>
<p><em>And if we go back to sort of, I don’t know, traditional sort of practices of the Luo people, I’ve heard quite a lot of teraburu and I was wondering if you had ever experienced that and if you have could you describe it to me?</em></p>
<p>That’s an interesting [laugh]. I’ve actually been in one, this was just around, the last one was in ninety ninety one an December, we had gone for a funeral, one of my cousin and it coincided with this terrible, terrible xxxx is when an elder person, when a respectable like a VIP person dies you know in our society he has got to be buried, I mean after his burial we have to come with all the cows because people use to come with all their cows to the funeral and just make noise and jump around with their spears like chase away the demons or to try and show that this is not just a normal person. If I die I probably would be buried with about twenty people around me coming to say, “Oh sorry”, yes but if a VIP person died then people would come as far as I would say Scotland walking to London just two or three days walking with their cows, you meet other people with cow on the way and say “Look we are going, so and so is dead”, so it’s just walking with your cows all the way and when they get there all the cows are driven into the home and everybody jumps and people and relatives and yes so that was teraburu.</p>
<p><em>Could you describe some of the, you mention then obviously the spears and things could you describe the traditional dress that people would have worn or would people of worn more modern clothes when you went?</em></p>
<p>All the people who could come in with their hide skins, and they don’t have any other clothing on just your hide skin to show that you are going to this funeral and carry the spear and the shield and as soon as they get to the home or the gate of the compound they start running around the compound and start scaring people with the spears, like somebody run to you and shout something like, “xxxx, xxxx,” and say like a xxxx, and some people would saying, it’s chaotic, it’s really, really chaotic, I wish one day if I go home I’ll do one video and bring it to you, it is really, really is chaotic and you wouldn’t know what is going on, you would thing everybody s mad because in the middle of the cows, the cows are confused, your just running in a big herd of animals, and they would take one male, one bull sorry, they get a bull, a big bull that has already been calmed down or castrated, they use to castrate them to make it, to keep their xxxx, so they are not hyper. This bull would be, when things have calmed down when all the people, because people come in at the same time and run around the compound so when things cool down they take this bull and take it into the house where the body is and the bull it just goes into the house, quietly, and they just try to talk to the person, I don’t know what they were saying but I would hear them shouting things, like a prayer, for about five or ten minutes then the bull would come out and I remember seeing them putting some ashes on the back of the bull and green leaves and just like whipping the bull quietly and talking to it nicely and it would walk out again, and that’s it, and after that they get food, probably porridge and maize, in big pots like that because they eat a long way [laugh], and they would feed and then about six o clock or five o clock in the evening they would start their journey back, everybody takes their hat and set back on their walk, yes.</p>
<p><em>It sounds incredible, it sounds like a real experience.</em></p>
<p>It was, and then after that, now the women would come with their singing just a xxxx of women with their tambourines and all those things and just sing around the compound and say things, how good this man was in this house here, and when that comes down then later the older people would sit somewhere under a tree and start laying out the strategy of how the body is going to be carried or how the burial is going to go on, depending on if this was a man or a lady who was dead, yes. But it was really, really hectic, it was chaos [laugh], yes.</p>
<p><em>It sounds like it was a very energetic sort of…</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, people come when, when some of them are drunk, some of them are, yes so you can imagine that situation, to be sober, just to walk in. The fascinating thing is that people would come with their cows, not just two or three, fifty, twenty five cows, just get all your herd out of the compound and take them to that home, and then at the end of that they all take them back home nothing is xxxx, and that was it, so that was tereburu for me.</p>
<p><em>It sounds fantastic</em>.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>I’d really love to experience that myself on day I think.</em></p>
<p>I might look for one video somewhere and share that with you one day.</p>
<p><em>Oh fantastic thank you.</em></p>
<p>I will make an effort, yes if they still go on {laugh].</p>
<p><em>Let’s hope so, let’s hope so. You mentioned then that obviously there would be food provided, can you remember any sort of traditional types of food that would have been eaten maybe like, people have mentioned ugali [?] before and things like that.</em></p>
<p>Yes. The main thing, the type of food I remember then because many people coming, there was maize, just maize being boiled overnight, in a big pot yes and porridge, they make porridge out of millet or out of, what is that called, is it called finger millet, there is millet and then there is another type of grain there that would be done, it’s sort of reddish, they make their porridge out of that so, without sugar anyway, so people would have just that really, maize and porridge and drink and drink and then in the evening they would slaughter a cow or a goat, so basically beef, yes, and ugali, and there is no rice no anything, that was it yes.</p>
<p><em>Could you describe ugali because obviously some of the people listening to this may not know what it is so I was wondering if maybe you could describe it?</em></p>
<p>I don’t think there is any other different way of making ugali, there is only one way, it’s basically dried maize and they would dry it in a, I remember seeing my grandmother doing this, they get the maize from the farm, leave it out to dry for like about a week and then it’s stored in, we use to have storage outside, sort of a hut that is just built for dried maize and should go in there and get maize whenever she wanted to cook, and she had a stone behind her house, I don’t know if you have seen that in one of the xxxx, so this stone was like a xxxx, it was a big stone and it’s shaped like this chair so there’s a dip in there and you put your maize here with another sort of that size stone exactly, so you get your maize in here and just grind it, that was our meal. So you grind it and then it becomes soft and use that to cook ugali, so ugali is basically just maize and you boil water xxxx and get your powder in there and stir it until the xxxx becomes sort of mushy and sticky then you let it steam a little bit for about five or six minutes and then take it out, that’s all it is, yes but it is very rich, very rich [laugh] yes.</p>
<p><em>Brilliant, and do you remember maybe your grandmother or your mother sort of making other sort of traditional dishes that you would have grown up eating sort of regularly or being quite fond of, specialities maybe that your mother or grandmother made?</em></p>
<p>We use to go, one of my uncles use to go hunting with his mates, a big group of about fifteen or twenty people, like once a month or every six months and I tasted rabbit for the first time [laugh], because they would go hunting for the whole day and come back when in the evening and one day they caught rabbits but my grandmother told me that rabbit is not to be cooked on the same day, it’s hung after taking off the skin and then it’s hung somewhere behind the cooking pot and the steam and all that smoke would go into it for about three weeks, and then after three weeks they would cook that and that was called aliya, that was it, it was very tasty and the first time I had it I saw it when it was already cooked but later when I went behind the kitchen to find out what was cooked, behind the scenes, where that meat was hanged there were maggots in the meat, because it’s shot and had been left there to hang for about, no freezing, no anything, or anything for about like about two three or four weeks, sometimes even a month, and then they would cook it with all those things. I eat it that night it was quite tasty, quite tasty. Had that, had antelope, they killed antelope one day, and is it quail, a little bird, pheasant, pheasant, very nice, very nice.</p>
<p><em>Sounds like you ate quite well, lovely sounding things.</em></p>
<p>Well yes I use to be very adventurous when I was young and every time I would go home, I’d make sure I would go home for holiday when there was an action going on, either funeral or there’s hunting going on so you don’t miss out yes so that was it.</p>
<p><em>So you timed that well.</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes so that was alright.</p>
<p><em>So what about things like weddings or other family occasions and things like that was there any other particular traditions that sort of you witnessed through them or…</em></p>
<p>I missed out, I had a near miss in one of the so called weddings, it was not a wedding. An auntie of one of my relatives was a, was it called kidnapped or something, they use to way lay them. She was way laid just a week before we got there and when we got home it was like, “No you can’t see your auntie anymore”, she was twenty, she was twenty or twenty four, because we were so fond of her because she would cook for us and take us to the river and get water with her, and so when we went home this day we were told, “No, no your auntie is now married she is not going to come back until whenever her husband let’s her come”. And we were told the story of how this happened. She went to the market, she was sent to the market to go and get, what was that, I think she had gone to get this, the ugali flour and come back with, because you take something to the market, sell your stuff, mill it and then come back with the ugali flour or maize. So she went with something, I think millet, I believe it was millet and she was coming back with the ugali flour and this was about six in the evening, it’s quite bright, six in the evening, and these people stopped on her way back, six men and just started whipping her and told her to put it down, put the thing down and lets go, and she was taken into this home and told, “This is your husband from today, leave that bucket down there we will tell someone to take it to your Mum’s house or we send your mum to come and get it and that was it. I was kind of disturbed, by the way this is a true story, I was kind of like how can he do that to this lady and she been so nice, I was moved me and my brother, my brother was actually crying because we felt like we didn’t have any of our mates to mingle about with and that was sad, but she got that whipping and she stayed and that was it, she had kids and now her kids are older people, some of them are in America yes. So that’s how she got married, that’s the only wedding I’ve heard of [laugh].</p>
<p><em>Was she happy? Later on maybe?</em></p>
<p>She’s happy now, yes she’s happy, she’s ended up having a co wife, she’s got now second wife in that home so yes we speak she’s okay, she’s fine yes.</p>
<p><em>I suppose it’s got a happy ending so.</em></p>
<p>It is a happy ending yes but it comes by very painful means by the way it comes in, yes so that don’t happen anymore, I don’t know if they happen and people are quiet to speak about it but yes people have had a bit of education now, enlightenment about that yes.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that is less common these days then or do you think it’s not talked about?</em></p>
<p>I think it’s not talked about but I think it’s still happening. Because I had somebody who was looking after, I’ve got a few cows, I’ve got about six cows and I had somebody who was looking at them and it’s my responsibility to make sure that that man lives at home, he is not from our society or community, he is actually a Ugandan because we get many people from Uganda or Tanzania our neighbours, to come and work in Kenya in the villages, so they come and look after cattle or look after home, like a security man while you are not there, you pay them. What was I paying, I think I was paying about eighty pounds a month, that’s about three or four thousand Kenya shillings [?] yes, and this man decided to run away with one of my cousins from the home, he got this girl and he made her pregnant, they had a child and I told them, “Fine, look alright this has happened, this is not good, you are not suppose to do that to one of my relatives because it gives me a bad name in the society. I’ve bought you here, I trusted you so you have done this. Eventually they just disappeared, they went with xxxx and now I hear they have got kids, they have got three or four kids, she was young she was actually a twelve year old girl, yes so, it still happens but people don’t talk about it and I can’t do anything, I can’t report it because I’m here and nobody listen to me. There is no system to report anything like that so she is there, she didn’t have her parents as well so it is a chain of many things put together, yes.</p>
<p><em>Sorry it’s quite sort of harrowing story when you think she is twelve years old but you know if she is happy then I suppose…</em></p>
<p>Yes so, you can imagine for a twelve year old for that to happen to you from the first day it happened and to having a baby and all that the trouble that comes with it and then you end up in another country where you don’t belong with no one, with kids, so I was a little bit concerned about that but that was it. I believe it still happen.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
<p>Yes but quietly.</p>
<p><em>Somebody else told me that in the Luo community if you want to get married you are suppose to sort of not ask permission so much but consult with the elders of your community first and they kind of have to okay it. Do you have any experience of that?</em></p>
<p>Just for the heart, what I have seen yes. It’s not really quite that but your parents would like ah investigate around, they would always like you to get married to somebody who they know their background about.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you wouldn’t just turn up and say alright okay now this is mine now. You have to like sort of say, “Alright, I’m in the U.K. now and I’ve meet a yes and she’s ABCD”, and he would go like, “No, where is she from? Where’s the Mum from, where’s the Dad from?” And then he’ll pick up from there, he’ll try and get one of the younger ladies or he’s cousins to come and investigate your home to try and find out what is going on, how are your parents, are they like strict family, well strict to them was are they married not divorcing or no other kind of you know, habits like prostitution. That was a nightmare. So they have to find out what is going on in your background before you come in, yes [laugh].</p>
<p><em>It’s quite interesting isn’t it to think someone is going to have to be investigated before they can get married really [laugh].</em></p>
<p>Yes so you could, it’s not a good thing to just turn up and say, “This is it”. and you have to say, right now I have to say okay I’m seeing this one, not seeing I’m getting married, I’m getting married to Felix, and then they look around and try and get some people who are from my area to look at how I was bought up, what’s my life style like, am I a drunkard, was I just playing about and yes, so there was a guide line, you don’t just get married, there still is I think a bit of that but know because of this kind of xxxx people have just decided to carry on yes.</p>
<p><em>When did you move to the U. K.?</em></p>
<p>Nineteen ninety nine, yes.</p>
<p><em>And what made you decide to move to the U. K. in nineteen ninety nine?</em></p>
<p>I came to the U. K. to study. I came to study in the U. K. for the first time; I went to back to Kenya for a year then came back again and then just decided to work. The second time I came back is because, when I came in the first time, went back and my Mum was not well, so in two thousand she passed away, and my younger brother went to Canada, so that’s it, that’s the end of the xxxx because I don’t have anything to hold onto now, so apart from my land and my xxxx and cousins, so I said I’m better of there, yes so I came here and try and fit in somewhere [laugh].</p>
<p><em>And what was your first impressions of the U. K. what did you think of it?</em></p>
<p>The first impressions of the U. K. was a mix of feelings, it was welcoming, it was my first time I was getting a true picture of how white people live, and my perspective back home of white people, we never had this thing of breaking down who the white people are, we couldn’t tell the difference from back then see someone was white we were, “Oh right your British yes”, we didn’t know you had to be Scottish or Irish or these things, so when I came here then I said like, “Where’s Ireland, where am I? Am I in England? And somebody said, when I was filling in an application form I said England and somebody said U. K. And somebody said “What’s going on here”. Then later I found alright there’s Scotland there’s that, yes, and all the xxxx and Wales, yes and that really fascinated me to find out that these people are not what we think back home, I should tell everyone yes, so that was a good picture that was xxxx information for me yes.</p>
<p><em>And how easy or difficult do you find it to maintain a sort of Luo community here in the U. K.?</em></p>
<p>It’s hard I think, it’s very difficult to get these people together. I’ve been talking to xxxx about this; one is because their pride, just the fact of being a Luo it’s a very difficult thing to deal with. Everybody wants everything for themselves; you want your stuff you want it very good that I would not keep to that standard. So if I call you to my house I want to make sure you come in and have all the fun and everything you might not have within me or within your reach so you should get them when you come into my house. So I think that has really raised the bar mark so everybody came into the U. K. say so I can live in my own house and live the way I want with my things with my family so why so I have to go and see xxxx. I think that has really stuck into Luo people’s head they really like this fancy life of big screen, I don’t know how many households you have been into [laugh]. If you go for your interviews, I believe they get a leather sofa, a very nice neat kept house, they like living well yes, and working hard by the way, yes. That pride has made it very hard to mingle and they don’t take things very lightly. If Luo people come to visit me, there are some jokes I would not just give around, like the humour that we get here I can’t bring my silly jokes there because they would take it very personal yes because they feel xxxx, now you are in the U. K. you think you can and you never see them again. And it’s just a sense of humour that oh now we are in the U. K. we can speak or free our mind, but they still hold back so much, so I think that has really bought a lot of kind of tensions and it makes it very hard to convince people to get together. So the closest thing that can bring them together is they must have music and some free food and make sure you treat them nice, and maybe free drinks, and then they will come. That is the first thing they will ask you, “Do you have drinks?” If you don’t they might come, they might come, [laugh] so yes we really need to work hard on that yes.</p>
<p><em>And what about the sort of things like, you know we talked a little bit earlier about influences on the traditions and things like that but things like do you ever sort of get together in this country and, in traditional dress or, I saw a little bit at the party night traditional dancing and things like that, is that quite common or is that quite difficult to…</em></p>
<p>It is difficult, like I said it’s the pride of the Luo, they don’t just let out everything, people are kind of keeping back what they have unless you insist come dress this way they would not, yes. And our traditional dressing, actually I can’t say we have a traditional dressing apart from if you have an occasion you could have the xxxx reeds, the xxxx reeds for the ladies and the men would have the hide skins that’s what I use to see way back but now all that has gone, we don’t have anything, we don’t have a national dress as Kenyans by the way, yes we don’t.</p>
<p><em>Sorry it’s in my head that someone rented a grass crown or something which stuck with me, is that something that you might not be familiar with say?</em></p>
<p>No, no, that’s the hat, yes basically the hat it, use to be made of reeds and only the older people would have it to, just to, like an I.D <em>.</em>then you would know because it’s not a new hat, it’s really old by the way and the older person would put on that yes, it’s not everybody who would have it, I see that a long time ago, but now, without xxxx knowledge people have got that made of different materials yes.</p>
<p><em>How does that make you feel that kind of you know people the Luo community in this country kind of keep themselves a bit separate?</em></p>
<p>It’s really bad to be honest, the last function we had we called so many people and they say no we’re coming, we’re coming but we know at the back of their hearts that they are not really coming fully like they are suppose to be coming out. So it wears you down a little bit after putting in so much and at the time it becomes less than what people committed, not nice, not nice, they really need to come out more, yes, we need to start door to door , knocking, getting them up because they are quite…</p>
<p><em>Picking them up and taking them.</em></p>
<p>Yes, that one can walk, that one can…</p>
<p><em>Send a cab for them they would have to come then.</em></p>
<p>I told Obiero if you , if you are looking for to make this thing work, make sure you get the bus somewhere in London and tell them, “Look if you get off at this station the bus will be there for three hours waiting for people to come in and we will drop you wherever and bring you to xxxx”, then they will come up, and we will drop them when they are ready because they are not people to, because you can’t rush them, you can’t, their pride is just too much yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>Is there anything else you would like to talk about either about your life or the community or the work that you do before I turn the tape off?</em></p>
<p>Yes, first the conception of this Luo session forum, there are other people who are also trying to do like I say the completion, everybody is cropping up with their own sort of charity things and for their own goals, I don’t know for whatever so if people could just stick to one goal and be like what our great grandparents use to be before, we only had one union called Luo Union. Luo Union was made with just one aim, to bring the Luos together so that we have something that we can call our self, identify our self with yes, and like I told you that was suppressed by the government and this generation that we are now in has picked that up and we need to get something simplified with just a short name like that, Luo Forum and make it I think free because if you tell them to subscribe they will not yes. They only come in when they have trouble, when somebody has a relative whose staying at home, you see them coming in and saying, “Alright, I’ve got my uncle who is dead so I need help”, then they will come but you can’t just get them in for like an occasion to interview them, it’s hard you have to follow them around, yes so that really, really worries me and it’s not getting any better because our children will just become the same, will be bad that generation yes.</p>
<p><em>Do you worry about that? Do you worry that the children won’t realise?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes, they won’t, they don’t see the importance of it because, we might still have that, they see it in us, going around and meeting friends, but without this commitment, with xxxx, xxxx here if we don’t get proper help I fear that our kids will not do it. The last time we were there you saw how many kids were there, and all those parents, everybody who was there, getting to about twenty, thirty people, they are all parents with kids here so they don’t give priority to their children to come in and just get this going on yes, so that’s one of the reasons while I’ve been, actually that’s why I came to see xxxx, because we need to speak about that. If we don’t do xxxx on kids then it’s not going to work.</p>
<p><em>What would you like to see? Would you like to see maybe sort of Luo history classes for young people or things like that so that they can get more involved do you think?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, I’d like to see the young people being identified with Luo, because there is Luoness in them but nobody is going to get that out of them yes, yes. You could go somewhere, for example you could go Kenya and you still want to be identify your roots as British yes, so you have that in you. Whether you live there for a hundred years you still have that in you because you know that but for our people who have come here or migrated here or to America or wherever there’s no, like a general forum that would put the kids up and say look we belong there, yes. We are British yes but this is where we get to know our roots so come in, let’s sit down together, let’s play our Luo music, let’s eat out Luo food, and just get to know each other, get some contact, mingle, speak to people, bring your friends, that's it.</p>
<p><em>It’s amazing.</em></p>
<p>It is yes, and you see until very late when President Obama came out and people started thinking, “Oh so he’s from Kenya”, so you break it down, he’s from Luo, so he’s from that area, so you see, but before we didn’t know all these things, I’m sure most of our kids still don’t know the roots of Obama, because there is no xxxx that gives us that access to say he’s from here, he’s from here, he’s American now actually.</p>
<p><em>Does that make you feel quite proud?</em></p>
<p>It does yes it does in a way we get to feel there is somebody from our side, yes.</p>
<p><em>He’s done so well in another country.</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes we are standing out, and we can yes, everybody can look at his life style now, he came out here, very shaky in the beginning but there he was, so that would be something inspiring the young ones and that is what I would like because if you, many of the people you interview how they came into this country there are many who are under the system, many of them are under the system, they wouldn’t like to speak but there is nothing, you need to go out and tell them there is nothing stopping them from speaking, they’ll thing, “Oh now alright this country is coming to interview me Oh my God, that must be the Home Office behind there”, [laugh] so we need to open this thing up and just make it social, a xxxx social, no payment, I don’t know who is going to fund it?</p>
<p><em>Yes it’s difficult</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>But this is why doing things like this is quite good because it raises the profile.</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, oh yes, I’m sure if we stick our heads up and come up with things like xxxx, come up with a Luo day, just to come, don’t make it so Luo, because we have sixty nine tribes from our country remember, so say xxxx and this is being organised by the Luoes so if other tribes would want to come in the same hall, look this is a Kenya hall, so other tribes could come in and say, “Today is a Kikuyu [?] Day but Luoes are still welcome, so we go and eat there food, they eat our food, and then from there we can get one head I believe.</p>
<p><em>Everyone together properly.</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that would help combat tribalism as well?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p><em>Getting all these people together.</em></p>
<p>It is, it is, we saw that coming up the last few years when we had elections, I don’t know if you saw that, and Luoes are being killed by Kikuyu, Luoes are chasing Kikuyu from our area. We had Kikuyu that lived in Luo land and we knew who were Luoes, like my neighbours I didn’t know they were Kikuyu, they speak Luo and for a very long time they lived there, and shops because they are kind of business minded people and when all this thing came up they were kicked out, they left their shops, all the shops were burned down, looted, just because of this tribal thing, political and tribalism that we picked from our old people, yes. So they were all done and dealt with and nobody sorted out that culture that was left from the Luo, if you understand what I mean, when the government started, that was not dealt with, I have that xxxx, my kids, I will not let them try to find out, I will not help them if it didn’t work out for me so unless we see it working then I can pull one or two kids of mine that is my thinking, I don’t know if you met other people was giving you a different view.</p>
<p><em>No I think more cohesion and sort of more community is what a lot of people want isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Exactly, yes.</p>
<p><em>And it’s not exclusive to anyone group either it’s a universal thing isn’t it so...</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, this is just the tip of the iceberg but actually a big thing what you are doing is a really fantastic job, yes a very big job, I don’t think it has been done anywhere, trying to get this little because they are tribes...</p>
<p><em>And some communities can be quite secretive as well can’t they so obviously you have to tread quite carefully [laugh].</em></p>
<p>Yes I know but you ask yourself why, what is there to hide? What is making them stoop so low and not come out and we are in the twenty first century and then you realise it’s the way that things were left and not dealt with and before you know it Christianity came in, there’s education came in, there’s westernisation and all this has cropped up so we didn’t have time to deal with that and that is why the division has, according to my understanding, yes there are just little loose ends there that need to be stitched together, yes.</p>
<p><em>Well if that is okay with you I think I’ve taken slightly longer than....</em></p>
<p>No it’s alright I came here for you today and yes so.</p>
