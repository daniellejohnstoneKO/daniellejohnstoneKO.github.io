<p><em>Ok, that is recoding now, can I ask you to say your full name and date of birth please?</em></p>
<p>Um Denny Mukunde 11/77 please</p>
<p><em>Ok and can I ask you to spell your surname please if that is ok</em></p>
<p>Um M-U-K-U-N-D-E</p>
<p><em>Brilliant, can I ask where you were born</em></p>
<p>I was born in xx ( Bujumbura) actually which is um part of the East Africa community, but it more on err the central part of East Africa</p>
<p>Ok fantastic, and what did your parent do for work</p>
<p>Aah my dad used to work for the government really yeah, he is a civil servant</p>
<p><em>And did your Mother work at all</em></p>
<p>Err, not later on in life, but not in the initial ages because culturally is the man who is the bread winner, so she then get, she was raising up children</p>
<p><em>Which is a full time job in itself isn’t it </em></p>
<p>It is, it is, in all capacity</p>
<p><em>Did you have many brothers or sisters? </em></p>
<p>Err large family, I mean because it is communal mostly, yeah so mostly we had step sisters, we had cousins who we called brothers, that is large collectively yeah</p>
<p><em>Brilliant it is fantastic, and can I ask what was your Father’s job in the government was if that is ok </em></p>
<p>Err he started off as a messenger, obviously then he used to work as a cyclist moving things from government office to government office, but later on in life he did get promoted in to a clerical opportunity , so he ending up working in one of the government offices</p>
<p><em>Fantastic, and if it ok we can just jump back a little bit and talk a bit about your child hood if that is ok, um are there any sort of particular um family traditions or your community traditions that you remember as a child, that you were involved in</em></p>
<p>Um not particularly, because of the part where I grow up, but culturally I have always observed with keen interest the traditional practises of um my people, and some of it would be, err um if somebody passed away in the family, there were cultural rights, that they used to do, ie; running with the cows,</p>
<p><em>Can you tell me little bit about that if that ok</em></p>
<p>What that involves, is for the first born of the family, if a member of the family is deceased then the first boy, would be woken up very early in the morning about six o’clock then they will go on a errand with all the cows from the homestret? xxx, and they’ll say that is to chase away any negative spirit, so the whole process is called err tero buru which means in English, err taking away the dust, so we believed that, man was taken from the dust and if he dies he goes back to the dust, and then the cows are used to chase away any evil spirits that may accompany the deceased.</p>
<p><em>It is fascinating, how young would you be aware that was a particular tradition, do you think</em></p>
<p>Um, I first become aware of it possible in my teens, but I haven’t be aware of it until actually saw it with my eyes then it took my with surprise and at the same time, it fascinated me, because it something I have only observed once yeah</p>
<p><em>In term of your fascination what was it in particular do you think fascinated you, was it the ideology of it, or the kind of visualness of it, do you think</em></p>
<p>The visualness of it, the ideology behind it, and the dress code, because people are clad in the traditional outfit and they had um, um like crowns made out of grass so that was to display a sense of royalty, and it involved the entire um village at the time,</p>
<p><em>It sound wonderful, and when you say that it was a crown of grass what was the rest of outfit like</em></p>
<p>Err we had for the people who grew up around the village area they had hides skins traditional outfit made out of goat skin, and some had no shirts on but err their private area were covered decently but err the rest had shirt, a t-shirt, but the people leading the procession where traditionally clad and they had to sort of err coronate the first born in that family and put the crown of grass traditionally on his head yeah.</p>
<p><em>It must be quite inspiring sense to see all that traditional dress</em></p>
<p>It was and it, and it started off at six, in the early morning and they were not back till about nine o’clock so we are looking at about hundred and eighty minute, so three hour of procession</p>
<p><em>That is long procession isn’t it? </em></p>
<p>Yes it was</p>
<p><em>They must have required quite a lot of energy to be able to part taken it for that amount of time</em></p>
<p>Yes it did and err the preparation because they had to traditionally set off early, before sun rise so I will presume they got up possibly about five in the morning most probably but by six they had to leave, so it was a drove of people just heading toward one direction (laughing)</p>
<p><em>It must have looked very impressive</em></p>
<p>It was yeah</p>
<p><em>It sound wonderful</em></p>
<p>It was just to witness it, and have a first class experience of what that really is and to later learn that this was, part of um ancestral tradition and it been carried on today, so just to see it in modern century was something that left me thinking deep about my heritage and roots.</p>
<p><em>Of course, and you said um I kind of get the impression that it was very impressive for you to see so many people in traditional dress, would people worn traditional dress on daily basis or was it more um some people did and another people wore sort of less traditional clothing or</em></p>
<p>Um historically as far as I recollect traditional clothing are used on big ceremony, i.e.; on weeding days or when somebody is vying for and high office or when they need to get and approval from the society, then we had our own special traditional regalia which has a lot of esteem and um to see that on that occasion as well, it depicted um the authority that we confined on to as a first born, in the family when they are bereaved because what that instigates is the fact that, somebody is taken leadership, the head of the home has perished so his responsibilities been transfer on to his first errm sibling so it wouldn’t be something that people will wear traditional outfit all the time on memorable occasions yeah</p>
<p><em>It like a right to passage</em></p>
<p>Yes it is, it those yeah because is something we still practise I mean um I haven’t been involved deeply in those traditional right but it is part of my make up, so I do observed when ie we had political leaders ascending in to offices they still had to go back to the village area, and then call on the elders of the community, a type of a chief who will then bring out the traditional tools, spear, um and err shield and head ornament, and then just confer the authority and blessing of the entire community, yeah so it still goes on to date yeah</p>
<p><em>It is amazing </em></p>
<p>It it</p>
<p><em>You mention about obviously the elders in the community, how many elders would they have been or was it just everybody over a certain age or in a certain position or</em></p>
<p>It is very interesting you ask that, because within there been changes throughout, our culture and traditional but one noted fact is, the head of the tribe still remains and the person is called ker ( k-e-r ) and it’s one person who represent the dynasty because we believed that um we came from Egypt and as nylots? we then migrated but we had to be under ruler ship of one head, so that headship has always been confer o to and individual, who then has his own councils, so he has a council of elders, which is like a cabinet but the dominant personality is one individual who then delegates who is who. Yeah..</p>
<p><em>And that is a kind of headship the ker is that sort of past down through a family then or</em></p>
<p>Ooh yes it been, but with modernity people have started asking question because we say, how can you nominate, and elder who might not even know an international language, so how can we hang on to traditional rights that can hold us back so there been challenges, to that sort of regime, and um the leadership is been tested in a sense that we have more advocacy, from people who had studied in modern universites, out of the country who then do not want to partake of that type of linage, because they deem the leader as ignorant to some extent, so it been challenged</p>
<p><em>(Laughing)</em></p>
<p>Currently as we speak (laughing)</p>
<p><em>So is that kind of a recently in the past decades or couple of decades that started to happen do you think</em></p>
<p>Err it just happen, as far as I am aware it happen within the last five years, because I do a lot of news reading and research and err we had um with the crisis in Libya, we had our leader who is call the ker, go up and try to reconcile with err Gadafi to some extent because we got people from our community, who actually live in Libya because we used to occupied Egypt then we moved down to East and central Africa, but we got part of the Nubians who still remain there, so the ker went and was trying to mediate between um the African union and Nato and then people then started asking question, was he politically um empowered to represent the views of an entire community, was it able to highlight the problems that are causing the crisis, so that’s when people started um questioning the role of this person, yeah because he been founded by the community, I assume because they have to be on wages, and yet there is poverty in our region so, it’s something that is coming under deep scrutiny yeah</p>
<p><em>But his main purpose I suppose was to look out for the interest of his community that were still in Libya</em></p>
<p>Yes still in Libya, because even after that we had um I think one of the Americans civil right leaders Jesse Jackson did say that there is alot of persecution of the black Africans in Libya, because they used to be the army in Gadafi’s regime, so most of them used to be in the military, which is something that is part of our heritage, because we had a lot of history of err being warriors, so he was just looking up for the best interest or people that we know belong to the err our generation</p>
<p><em>It is really interesting, to hear this sort of politic of it as well</em></p>
<p>Yes it is, it is very –very political but um I think historically, to know that we had um a dominant influence in the South and err Southern Sudan yeah, because the Luo from Sudan and the Luo in Kenya, we speak the same language, so we understand, we might not be in mediate brothers and sister, but we do share a common heritage yeah, so that is the role of the ker is just to unite the all the tribes, because we are quite a large community, yeah where we settle now in Eastern and Central Africa just in one part in Kenya we got um twelve regions, now this twelve region even those we are from one tribe, we have differences because you will find one part has a different um mannerism, from another tribe, and one tribe might say no you can’t married from that area, because you are brothers and sisters right, so where I settle before I even decided to married, you have to called your Father your Mother and they have to trace the generation, and they say no you can’t married, because you are closely xxx so then we have to look into another part, of the um Luo community and then go and married from (laughing)</p>
<p><em>(Laughing) it sound quite a complicated process really, doesn’t it? </em></p>
<p>Yes it is, it is because, we all came, the person who we take after the leader is called ramogi is a leader that is like um, how would I put it, is like a king, he had historically from what I have heard , he had so many wives, but all this wives end up having about twelve sons, this twelve sons all settled in one area, so then it was difficult because some had daughters some had sons, and we had to prohibit marrying from that particular area, until other Luo came from different areas, and then we could go and marry them, so there is always been that type of scrutiny when it come to marriages, we have to really dig deep, sometimes two there generations before you are allowed to rightfully have your wife (laughing)</p>
<p><em>It is fascinating we are talking a little bit you know xxx the rules in ration to marriage could sort of describe a typical weeding to me if that is ok, if it is possible </em></p>
<p>Um I haven witness, but I will just used my parent as an example, because in our culture we marry through recommendations ie somebody had a daughter who is good, beautiful, well manner, well cultured, there is always somebody proposing ansd say aah I think your daughter will be good for my son, so wedding’s have always been done that way, and it just today I was talking to one of our community members and they decided they, I think it is my time to get married, so I need to go and speak to err one of the elders, and then just get them to get me a nice, decent, beautiful girl yes, he is hoping to travel, not to say that there are no women in this country, but I think traditionally you find it a lot more safer, and the reason why we used to we are very particular about our weddings is, when we moved in to East Africa we found a lot of tribes there, now as soon as we came in, there was war, when the British came, they found that we were engaged in serious civil war, among other tribes as well. Because we are fishermen and we had to secure the lake basins, we literally we drove out all the tribes and occupied the lake basin, so we never used to allow other tribes to come and marry, until very recently so Luo are very particular, they never like intermarriages, because we had a heritage to preserve, been in a country we were not the indigenous people, we never gave our trust to anybody, but that has stared changing recently because you had Luo marrying from other tribes, europeans, locals tribes but it not a commonly practised errm activity, it is still Luo and Luo, or in very rare occasions Luo and somebody from outside, so marriage were deemed very, very sacred there.</p>
<p><em>And important like you say preserved the heritages of your people </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So you never actually witness sort of ceremony or something like that </em></p>
<p>Ooh I have, but the way it done um, it is modernised</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Yeah, because we, I believe the second generation, from our peers, so our peers were more traditional, but we are more modernised to some extent. I like to say in comparison to how our peers started off so even though the wedding is done in a modern day setting, the ethic or the ethos of it still remains, you still have to involve the elders and they have to come and then bless the marriage, because we believe we don't like divorce, I mean it something really unheard of in our culture, but we see it a lot now, because possibly people don't value the co principles</p>
<p><em>Even within the Luo community </em></p>
<p>Ooh yeah</p>
<p><em>Ooh really</em></p>
<p>It happening now, I think people are getting a liberal mind so in comparison to the values we hold I mean there might be, a seeming clash.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But we still hold dearly, our um marriage values, yeah because we consider it um a sacred institution.</p>
<p><em>What do you think of those morden influences do you think, do you think some of them are good thing and some of them are bad thing, and can you think of any examples of modern influences you think is good or bad you think if that even possible(laughing) it a quite broad question I appreciated that</em></p>
<p>Yes it is quite broad, I mean being the person we are, I mean we are very democratic</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>So always advance for change but what I have seen within our particular ethnic groups is people have become too liberal, and lost the balance in liberality, so I support changed in a way, because time have to moved, and you have to change with the flow of the season, yes we seen a lot of good thing, and we also seen a lot of negative things, but I can’t really attribute that to change, because we have always have our mind to change (laughing) been a luo, we always focal I mean we always question things, I do a lot of questioning, but as long as the question is put forward to help then there is nothing wrong with that</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>As long as you ask a question with an answer that you placed on the table as an alternative then, changed really should not be balm for our own um xxx I think what we are experiencing and blaming on modernity the fact that possibly we need to kind of slow down and then just allowed changed and growth to be couple together</p>
<p><em>It is quite interesting what you say about the Luo people been you know quite democratic and quite you know sort of out spoken sort of people, because I did little bit of research and they</em> <em>do seem lot of people from the Luo community that seem to do quite well in things like politics or sort of you know right movement and thing like that, and I was wondering whether that is inherent in the culture or whether you think that is kind of a learned thing in particular family</em> or</p>
<p>I think I will like to say I mean with xxx, I think it is genetic I mean when I say that, base in the fact that we do a lot of observation being fishermen I mean, you expose to the sea, you expose to nature, then when you look at the animals for instance, one thing that we really lay our um educational achievement on is really observing, tiny species like the ant for instance if you study how they exercise the ruler ship is quite fascinating because there are so many species of ant, and they all perform different functions, and I remember one day I was seated and I most have stood in the path of an ant , and I was at xxx because I was in the village and there was no light, so I was there screaming, because I just felt my body being rip apart, I don't know what it was, and I was screaming and I literarily have to strip myself naked, just to realised this were pharaohs ant that I stood on that their path, and they were massively weighing me down, so then I have seat and start studying the ants, and see how could this small creature almost humiliate me in front of a whole procession and then I started realising that the ant really, they are very smart people they are small, but they share common intelligence they are very democratic, they devolve their system, they store their food, and that has always been the bed rock of my reasoning, so I say if I know something I will break it down to a way that, will help you, so that what our people because we been always been referred to as ants, and um even onetime I remember my Mum seating down and looking at ant and calling me and saying “look at this people” if only a government could work like this</p>
<p><em>(Laughing)</em></p>
<p>We could have no course to conflict would we?</p>
<p><em>It is a good point, if politician where like worker ants we wouldn’t have much problem would we</em></p>
<p>So, that is where we get our inspiration from, I think it just the rules of natural consequence if you pay attention to what nature has to offer, then you learn alot, but in as much as we also vocal in civil right movement, I always tell my people to, one thing I considered is we need to learn, the art of bringing out information, in a way somebody will not feel intermediated (laughing) because I will say Luo sometimes would come a very intermediated, you present a fact xxx (order that it is) but you need to explain were you getting it from, so usually think that we need to balance that yes we had a lot of change lot of contribution academically , politically, but we need to involved everybody that is why, xxx yeah we need to refer every one to the ants, every one to the xxx everyone to the spiders, and then everyone to the xxx who are also a small people they do the same thing as ant yeah, so</p>
<p><em>So relating everything back to sort of nature</em></p>
<p>Yeah, because that is where I believed we get our wisdom from fish, you are a fisher man, you have to learn about physic, so how we will you get your boat, you have to float so it just a little observation yeah, but the sad thing is our area is still very under develop, in as much as we have people in high places but something is not been brought back to the ground, so I will say it time that we started paying more attention to what nature has to offer, and then work in relations to what other small creatures are doing yeah</p>
<p><em>That is wonderful I am just curious when did you come to the UK</em></p>
<p>Um I been in the UK I came in 97</p>
<p><em>97 ok, and what was your reason of coming over in 97</em></p>
<p>Um usually I mean we had a lot of, historically we had a lot of persecutions yeah, we had if you look at the history of political assassination there is no other tribe that has been affected, more than the Luo people. That’s not just in Kenya, in Uganda, in Tanzania, in Zanzibar as well, and um there are period in time as late as 2007 as well where we had err ethnic cleaning and I think the case is still at the Hague where we’ve always suffered um disadvantage for being too vocal I mean that is not to say that it a particular tribe being targeted because other people from other tribes as well share the same fate, so most of us had to leave for political reason yeah, if that was not the case then, yeah we probably will back to the dust as well (laughing)</p>
<p><em>Yeah It kind of quite sad really isn’t it you feel that you had because you spoke your mind, you kind of feel that if it doesn’t go against you know if it goes what the government or whoever is official in charge of the time it can be a bit wrong yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah that happen, and I think as well, I mean um because we been vocal I mean yeah throughout the years university if you look at the student campaigns, it’s just the same thing but is how you say it, because you could say a right thing to somebody who might preserve it differently, and they might then start persecuting you yeah, sometimes if there is a safe get away then it good to see what the world can offer</p>
<p><em>What was your first impression of the UK when you first came here?</em></p>
<p>Ooh very-very interesting yeah, because UK offers ours um a chance really it just an image of what we always had inspiration for, yeah tolerant, democratic society, where laws are respected, where people are valued for their contributions, where um people will share their experiences, share their knowledge ,where education you can start learning at whatever level regardless of how you educational background, so UK was quite interesting, I remember my first experience, was um it was with an immigration officer yeah, she was a lady and err she was asking me questions, we were talking, and she was elderly and she was very –very compassionate in a sense that she listened to what I was saying, she asked me questions, I answered her back, in full sentences and she was impressed, I mean she was just helpful, that was my first contact, so after that then the language barrier, even though I speak in English but I had problem with different accent, because I have meet some people from Scotland or Ireland I just can’t understand what they are saying,</p>
<p><em>I have the same problems (laughing)</em></p>
<p>It took me a long time yeah to get to learn what, um the indigenous English man was trying to put across with, but with time, my ears open and then yeah, I found England to be a very interesting place yeah, I have been here since then (laughing)</p>
<p><em>And still happy (laughing) </em></p>
<p>Um yes ooh yeah, because with time you develop you grow and then you then realised you have the same responsibility, as you to have had at home, and then I have seen England changed over the years in term of um cultural integration in terms of values, and now the same sense of change that we had in Kenya, is what we are seeing here as well, yeah so I listen to UK politics I follow what the politician have to say, I am actually studying law, because I am still going to uni, and then hopefully get in to government and polities yeah, so really I will say UK has offer a life time opportunity yeah, and the same duties we own our country, is the same duties we own England, because we have to put something back we might not have the money, but we might have the experience and knowledge, at least to help somebody, because we got generation of err our people growing up, and I think this is one of the course why we are involved in what we are doing now</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Yeah (laughing)</p>
<p><em>It think it is wonderful you know, how difficult do you find it sort maintaining more traditional values or traditions in this country then you did when you where back in sort of East Africa</em></p>
<p>UM one thing that we find difficult to detach from is the food, because</p>
<p><em>Because English food is blank and terrible (laughing)</em></p>
<p>So that has really –really xxx and the fact sometime you share accommodation, how of multiple occupants, you get different tenant, and you still have to cook your traditional food, sometimes the scent of the food itself might not be aroma friendly to the rest of the people, so you have to sort of introduce your culture to them, and then speak before hand tell them the type of food you eat and so when you prepared it they are not taken by smoke shock, so what happen is, we build up very good relationship with most of the um the different community here in the UK, some of them tend to love the food so culturally, that is being addressed because we can get our traditional foods, the other traditional um concept I don't really share that type of believed because we always believed a woman should not work, it a man who work, and provide for the woman, but my Mum changed that because she defied my dad um proposition saying no I have to get myself work, some of those traditions I don't hold, neither do my friends who grow up within my same time but, the rest of it Luo traditionally a lot has been changing because, I have just said we never used to circumcise, but that has been defied over the years because people started asking why?</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So we excising the right of freedom of, of course matching it up to scientific evidence, because now, recently they discover circumcision does diminish some percentage of um aids err possibility towards infection so, what did err people in my Luo belt do? All of them rushed to be to be circumcised. So we that kind of people, if we seen sense in something we will follow it, if we don't see sense in something, you will have more chance in meeting the pope then convincing us yes so , something we hold some we let go, yeah, because we are Modern democratic that is how we describe ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Brilliant, it there anything else about obviously yourself you know the Luo people or anything else you will like to say for the recording or anything that you like to be</em></p>
<p>Yeah it just the language, because I fascinated by the Luo language and I believed it’s an ancient language that dominated err the world at one point, why do I say that because I always tell people everyone is a Luo man, and they asked me why do you say that? Because everything that is spoken be it in English, be it in Hebrew, be it in German, it has a Luo inclination in one way or the other, so why do I say that for instance, the Germans they will say achum that means stop, and that is the same thing we say in Luo xxx I am standing, and then there are so many dialects’ that sometimes I see it and pick up something in my language but it is spoken in English, for instance the name Solomon, that was like Hebrew name, now Solomon was a king who got a lot of wives, now in luo somebody who takes a lot of wives does a process called Solomon, that somebody who taken wives, that is exactly what Solomon did, so when I was reading that story, I thinking Solomon, Solomon it sound repetitive but am calling out the name Solomon, and then I am speaking in luo, so-lo-mon, so the luo language is poetic, it’s expressive, it’s artistic but unless you understand how it flows, you can used the same the letters and talk for two houre like I said so-lo-mon ooh so-lo-mon, so-lo-mon, Solomon, oolo-so-mon, mon-mo-solomon,lo-so, so it is the same xxx been used and it is producing a language, so am thinking this is very artistic, and that is what inspire me, and sometimes I am in class, and I am stock, but if I interprets things in Luo then I get all other various and I am able to write my essay, and the teachers are asking me, how did you? I said I just, I believed Luo is the language of the soul, and the soul bring out loved, the soul brings out compassion literally the soul is who you are because, that’s the core of your existence that is your conscience, that’s where your moral dialect is, that is where law of conscience, are all embedded so as Luo we always believed in a supreme being, we believe in one god, so if we relate to nature then we relate to a god who created all things, so one thing that makes Luo unique I can say is the fact that we welcome anybody, you can come to our culture, and I won’t feel intermediated, I will be willling to learn from you, so if I see you are good in doing something, I will tell you my lady Claire you are suited for the job, you do everything, I will work under you, that the sort of people we are, and um that comes from the soul, and I have seen it help me in so many ways it help my community in like we get along with anybody, we don't like pedigree, we don't like victimization, if somebody soak wrong about somebody I will call them aside and tell them that, that is not ethical you shouldn’t do that, so we always loved people, and we tell people everyone is a Luo, because it is a language of the soul, and from the soul you get the letter L-U-O which is Luo, in fact soul is written the other way is Luo (laughing(</p>
<p><em>So all makes sense isn’t, all comes round</em></p>
<p>That is right, I don't that before I close, there is this German, um I think he was a German philosoper, or a German doctor, he made a statement in the eighteen century and say the people who rule in the ascent Egypt they spoke a language and his believes was that tribe still remain there today, so he came to East Africa form Egypt and he trace that because he had certain dialect in him, and guess where he end up, he ended up in the Luo land, in xxx so when the Germans came, they are the first nation who colonised the Luo area before the British came and the Germans we got on along with then, because we used to understand their language, if we take time and study we used to literally understand what they were saying, and in Tanzania because we got Luo there as well the German were beating and they were wondering how are this people intercepting our intension, but the answer was in the languages so people could seat down and just hear what they are saying, decoded it turn it round and it was all coming up to a language that was easy to understand, so they had to leave, so what we are saying is, we all share that common language, it not, Luo are not just a people man, it peoples, because everybody has a soul, and it is that soul that unit us, and makes us all one, so we don't look at race, we don't look at colour, we don't look at predigest, we well come everybody, and we work with every body</p>
<p><em>It sound like a wonderful philosophy to lived by doesn’t it (laughing)</em></p>
<p>It is because if you loved somebody, you don't do somebody wrong yeah,</p>
<p><em>It fantastic sorry I just remember one more question I would like to ask if that is ok</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Um you mention early about obviously when you where learning to live with other people you know, things like food things like that , are there any traditional sort of um particular dishes that kind of jump out in your mind you know, yours and you had to introduce to you know your friends when you where livening with them</em></p>
<p>Yeah with Luo, it’s just standard you can’t detach a Luo from a fish.</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>But is how we make it</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Like now I got um Polish resident and they always you and your fish</p>
<p><em>(Laughing)</em></p>
<p>Xxx (laughing) and they see me coming with shopping yeah; fish is our main delicacy that is we have always esteemed, I don't know why, but that’s what we really like yeah</p>
<p><em>Ok, do you think that relate back to obviously what you where saying earlier you are fishing men so you know it kind of </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Directly translate isn’t it</em></p>
<p>It dose yeah and we also learn a lot from the fish, yeah because the fish gives us curiosity into the marine life.</p>
<p><em>Um </em></p>
<p>Yeah so, it just something that I can’t explain but we always had a very deep connection to the species yeah.</p>
<p><em>Fantastic ok well thank you very –very much for been interviewed I will err stop the tape now and let you go back to your party</em></p>
<p>It my good pleasure Claire</p>
