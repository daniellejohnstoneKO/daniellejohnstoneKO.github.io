<p><em>Can you just start by telling me your name for the tape?</em></p>
<p>My name is Beldine Nee</p>
<p><em>So that’s Nee, N?</em></p>
<p>N-double E</p>
<p><em>And how old are you Beldine?</em></p>
<p>I’m forty-three years old.</p>
<p><em>And where were you born?</em></p>
<p>I was born in the village called XXXX Kenya and in a town called Kisumu.</p>
<p><em>And can you tell me a little bit about the town you were born in because I can’t pronounce it, sorry</em></p>
<p>The town I was born in is the town which is used to be traditionally I was told by my grand mum that it was it was um it started out as a long time when business’ people used to exchange business’ so somebody would bring like oil you know like cow oil, oil from ghee and the other person would bring pots, the African pots made from soil and people would bring different, different things and they started gathering, they started gathering in that area and then by gathering in the area in my Luo traditional sumo means buy, shopping. Sumo means shopping so it’s, they I don’t know where the word Kisumu came to make it Kisumu, sumo means shopping so because the place was a place for shopping, became like a market they names it Kisumu, Kisumu which means like a shopping area or a shopping mall or a shopping market. Something like that, that is how my grandmother told us the name started.</p>
<p><em>And you are from the Luo community?</em></p>
<p>I’m from Luo community.</p>
<p><em>Right and, oh I’ve forgotten my question sorry it’s early on a Saturday morning. So can you tell me a little bit about growing up in the town?</em></p>
<p>Um. Growing up in the town was not easy. It was not easy it was very very difficult. We didn’t grow up, I never grew up in a very very soft life it was a very very hard life because when I was growing up education just came up. The area I am born in is the area by where the missionaries started coming, it’s one of the areas where missionaries started coming when they came to Kenya. So we’ve got a very very old church that they say is over two hundred years and it’s still there. So when the missionaries came they started introducing education they brought in a church and then I think people started thinking widely. They started changing people’s lifestyle by preaching the word of God by teaching about education and then people’s lives started changing so my grandmother was among those people who are with the missionaries who are regarded with the missionaries and I have the photos that she took those XXXX of years back with the missionaries the white missionaries. So that in my area is one of the areas that started experiencing change of life where I was born so when the missionaries came, education started, people started going to school, people started learning about the word of God, people started changing the way of dressing the way of behaving the way of life so my mother when she got married to my father, my mother where she came from they never used to believe in education especially for girls. Girls used to look after children, used to bring firewood, look after the kitchen, they taught them how to look after the kitchen, look after themselves and how when they get married how they should look after the husband so my mother never went to proper school because of that and because of where she came from. The education and the system had not started changing so when she joined her husband, which is my dad, to where I was born and brought up which the missionaries started coming and there was change of thinking, education people started realising that education was important my dad, because he had been educated, before he was never educated used to look after cattle and when the missionaries came and things started changing, schools were being built you know they used to start by going to school under trees, very big trees because there wasn’t buildings and the school was under a tree, that was school. In case it was raining they would shelter under the tree so that is where my dad started. So as the missionaries came and things started changing they started building schools which wasn’t in very good condition but was better than nothing you know they would just build something and use soil to to clay to build it and to do it, it wasn’t very nice but good for that time. So when my mother was married to my dad, because my mother was married in an area where there was develop, I mean the missionaries had come to introduce schooling and life was starting to change, my father decided to take my mother to school. So my mother when to school because my dad knew the importance of school and in that area development of schools had began because of the missionaries so my mother was interested and she was, you know when you’re hungry to do something? You really want it because you’ve never had the opportunity to do it so when my mother was married she started going to school so she was a woman who giving birth to us children as well as going to school. So she was going to school at the same time as she was a mother and a wife. So while this was going on my grandmother who was the one who was one of the ones who met the missionaries was looking after us so my mother would give a bath to us and give us up to our grandmother to look after us. So when I was growing up I never grew up in the hands of my mother I grew up in the hands of my grandmother.</p>
<p><em>Did your grandmother ever talk about the missionaries and what they did?</em></p>
<p>Yes she did talk about the missionaries and what they did.</p>
<p><em>Can you tell me a little bit about that?</em></p>
<p>Okay, she said when the missionaries came to Kenya they mostly they preached about schooling, the importance of why it’s important to attend school the importance of why they introduced school which promoted the hygienic side like they started to introduce toilets because we never used to have toilets, we used to have go to the bushes you know so when they came they introduced things like they would preach the importance of toilets then they introduced schools to teach about the hygienic, why it’s important to have toilets and just not use the bushes. The importance of having clothes, the importance of having hospitals to treat and things like that so people became interested and people started listening and people started joining the church because people realised that they wanted to know what was going on and uh wanted to a new something new in their life so people started flocking in church because from church they got an opportunity of joining schools because it was like church from church you join church and the preaching started and then church was connected to schools.</p>
<p><em>So you couldn’t go to school unless you went to church?</em></p>
<p>You could still go to school but that was like a gateway because it was important, when you go to church that is when the preaching they will tell you about the importance of school and then from there a parent will decide to make their take their children to school and not just let their children, boys, look after cattle and girls look after children and go to look after firewood, cook at home just teach them how to look after husband. They preached that there was something more than that there’s something better than that.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that was a good thing?</em></p>
<p>It was a good thing because thinking about it the lifestyle was not bad that was culture, which I respect, but there’s some areas that I think is good especially when it come to hygienic because we never used to have toilets and now we have toilets, people used to just go anywhere because they didn’t of they weren’t aware of the hygienic side of life so at that point it was good but at some point I would say that it’s changed the way of life which now has made some people’s life difficult or complicated because I would say that money, when I talk in terms of money wise, I think the trade the XXXX trade that the Luo used or the people used was I think was better.</p>
<p><em>Fairer?</em></p>
<p>Was fairer. Because you could have you’d. what they’d used to do was they’d plant their crops, XXXX, cassava, potato, maize all those sort of things because they never used to have jobs to go to work it was all men was to go building where which they did in joint, it was join effort. Son of so and so is building a house all the community would go and join, it was a joint effort there was nothing like somebody’s paying someone to do the job. It was joint effort, which was amazing.</p>
<p><em>Amazing</em></p>
<p>So woman, daughter of so and so has started her periods they would bring the aunt which is the sister to the father like for example my father’s sister, my dad’s sister. When I started my periods she’s the one who would leave where she’s married, come back home to my parents where she belongs and teach me how to look after my periods that was the aunts, the aunt who is the sister to the dad that was her job so once I start my period she would come. Period they used to use leaves, it was leaves and during the period time you’re not allowed to mix, it was private and when a child was on period they were put in a private location until the period was over because blood was not, it was private and nobody was allowed to see blood of someone, it was private. So the aunt would keep the girl in a private location, they would use leaves as pads to cover themselves because they never used to have knickers, there were never knickers. So they would use pad and you see the banana leaves they used to use the banana leaves to wear they would put during the period time they would take the banana leaves and put and then on the banana tree, it’s hard to explain but when I go home I will bring when it’s dry you can get a string, there’s a string that would come out of it and that string they would dry it was very very important they used to dry the string from the banana tree and then use it to tie one side of the banana one side of the banana leaf and the other side of the banana leaf so that the when the leaf which was used like pad was down there it can’t fall. And so it won’t fall to expose the blood. So the mum would keep the girl in this location, take the girl very early in the morning to the river, not home, because every area used to have rivers now rivers are dry because of climate change so they would go to the river, was the girl very early, the first thing in the morning at half four, not five half four, why half four? Because people never used to have tap running it was completely river they never used to know tap, nobody had tap so the river would be the only way of water. So why the aunt would take the girl to the river at that time because at that time everybody is in bed asleep and because the river runs down you would go there, wash her, make sure she washes herself because before anybody else start using water because at five people start going to get water and water for drinking must must be drawn at five in the morning, that was a rule because at five people because people used to wash themselves in the river you just strip and you wash so at five they believe the water is still fresh and clean so they use the water so they wash at that time, they draw water at that time for drinking, that is drinking water at five, six is washing water they could use for washing because at six everyone is awake and they’re in the river people are washing ready to start that day. So five was time for was time for washing for water for drinking, they put in the big pots, cool in the pots at the side of the house, which they still even have up to today at the corner. Six no more water for drinking for pots, people have now started washing themselves in the river, people have started washing their clothes people have started using the river so no more water from six, why this child is taken at half four is before anybody else starting to use the river at half four and because the privacy of blood nobody was allowed to see the blood so that’s why they go very early in the morning so wash themselves and to wash the blood. So when people go to get water in the morning they will have finished and she will be gone and when people wake up she will be a clean girl and no blood will be seen even if she had any accidents and even the leaves that would have been used to protect her blood would have been safely kept they would go and dig and bury it in a grave because there never used to be toilets, bury the blood in the grave so that nobody would know where the blood is because blood is forbidden to see, they would tell you that if somebody saw your blood, which I think was just a way of making people more careful that you never give birth, if anybody by any chance ever sees your blood you will never give birth and giving birth was very important as everyone wants to have a child so you would really try and let your blood not be seen and because your aunt also would make sure the daughter of her brother doesn’t let the anyone see their blood and blame her in future that because you let my blood be seen by someone then I can’t have a child. So where I grew up it was not easy we grew up in a very very tough life because when I was growing up my grandmother looked after us and our grandmother also because there never used to be like today you go to supermarket and you buy food, nothing like that you had to plant your own food we never used to depend on shops the only things we would buy in shops were things like sugar besides sugar anything else we depended on because I never grew up eating bread, bread I only started eating when I was growing up in our time bread was like not there. It was like we used to use like potatoes, was like our bread for breakfast you’d eat potatoes you’d eat cassava, you’d eat mixed corn, the white corn with beans, that’s what we grew up eating as we were growing up so it was the duty, because my mother was going to school it was the duty of my grandmother to make sure food was on the table to make sure everything was on the table for us as children because she was doing this for my mum to go to school because education had come my grandmother was among the officials of the missionaries so she was really doing her duty well and she understood the meaning and the importance of education. So while you are growing up we never, the school where I was going was very far because at that time there was no schools. Like my dad will tell you he went to a school where by he would walk for three hours that was the nearest school.</p>
<p><em>My goodness</em></p>
<p>Three hours</p>
<p><em>It’s unbelievable isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Before he got to school and he said by the time you get to school you’re exhausted. You go to school you have to learn because at that time education was serious, it was not like today people, we play with education, you just go to school for granted (?) it was education was very serious and three hours to walk to school and because where I am born is mountainous, I’m born in a mountainous area so when you go to school he goes through the mountain, you pass through the animals, dangerous animals. Leopard, cheetah, name it so you’d risk just to get an education you’d risk going through all of this to get to school. Going to school, coming back is three hours when you get home your mother is waiting for you to do your usual chores because life at home has to go on as usual. It was tough.</p>
<p><em>What were your usual chores?</em></p>
<p>Usual chores at home was when they come back they had to make sure that for boys or for girls?</p>
<p><em>For both maybe</em></p>
<p>For boys it was looking after the cattle, like before my dad would set off to go to school they have to make sure they remove the cows from where the cows are kept and move the cows to a location where they would be milked so because they’re going to school they’d leave the cows for their dad or grandmother in a location where by they’d do the milking then they’d have done their part because if they’re going to school they’re going to school. When they come back they’d make sure the cows are moved to the place where it was just open, they never used to have houses they’d move the cows to the location where the cows will sleep then the next morning the same. So school didn’t interfere with everyday life so at the same time as they were going to school they had to do all of this. As also when I was going to school as much as we were being looked after by our grandmother when we got to that stage where you could work in the way any child could work we were introduced to working we were mainly asked it was going to get firewood in the bush, I grew up with firewood I never grew up using charcoal. Charcoal, no it was XXXX it was XXXX and charcoal came as I was seeing and it was very XXXX so I grew up using firewood. We would go into the bush in the morning we go in the bush and we get firewood we bring it to home and our grandmother would use it to cook for us. At two in the morning it was twice, at two in the morning we would go and get firewood for cooking tea I mean breakfast whatever it was it was never tea it was African porridge I never grew up drinking tea I grew up drinking African porridge. So you would go in the morning in the bush, get firewood, bring it back home to my grandmother she would cook, use the firewood to cook, sit down, wait because we were at that stage or we would do just normal house work cleaning because we never used to, I grew up in a house made of mud I never grew up in a house made of cement so there was never moping we would just clean, sweep it was mainly just sweeping, never cleaning of dust because the more you clean a mud house the more you spoil it because you can’t clean the dust out of it you’d be spoiling the mud so you have to be careful so you’d sweep the floor, in the morning you’d be taught you’d be shown to sweep the floor, to make sure the chairs are back in to normal because we used to sleep on the floor they would spread a mat then we’d sleep on the floor then we used to cover ourselves in you see something like this, let me show you what we used to use to cover ourselves in we never used to have blankets so we used to cover ourselves with this.</p>
<p><em>Hessian?</em></p>
<p>Yes this is what I grew up covering myself in yeah this is what I grew up covering. So we’d sleep on the floor we never used to have bedrooms there never used to be bedrooms it was just a house like the whole of this that corner was fireplace, this corner was eating place which we never used to sit on chairs, we used to sit flat on the floor and we had to sit, our legs because there was no space so we had to sit our legs crossed so that food would be put in front, we would sit here this is food, someone would be sitting here food crossed, food crossed, food crossed, food crossed. And food would be put on one plate, if it was for example if it was flour it’d be on one plate shared by everybody on that one plate if it was vegetables, African traditional Luo vegetable it would be put on the same plate and everybody would use that same plate you would take the flour from the same plate everyone and share that other plate there. It was just one plate for flour, one plate for vegetable and everybody would share there so when it’s finished you had to take the plate away. Not our grandmother, us as children you stand up, when everyone has finished you had to wait not everybody finishing and you walk away. You had to wait until everyone was finished then you stand up and if it is my duty today to go and take the plate away and wash it I would take it out, we used to wash outside just on the floor outside, and you would take the plate there it’s my duty today when everyone is finished I take the flour plate and the other one and go and wash it. That is from the age of four, there is nothing like a baby, the baby was finished by three by four they start treating you as a normal child, even though you will go and wash the plate you won’t wash it perfectly but as you wash it as you get along you will learn still my grandmother would come back later and wash it properly but you’d have washed it in the first incident so as you grow up you grow up knowing that this is part of what I am supposed to be doing so they never used to start at a late age where by you will turn around and say this is not my duty so they used to start at the age of four you’d start at four, even though you wouldn’t wash it it was only two plates never used to be a lot because the plate was made from mud we never, when I go home I’ll bring the plate was made from mud we didn’t have this kind of plate so you’d go and wash and you’d have to be careful because that plate was very precious and we had to look after it properly because people’s lives wasn’t as easy as you’d imagine.</p>
<p><em>How many of you were there?</em></p>
<p>In my family we were a family of eight but I would say from number one to number five we went through a lot of problems we went through a hard time then from number six onwards life changed so we started living in a cemented house, it wasn’t very nice but as I grew up living in a grass thatched house and it was just one room, it was one room that was that size up to you see where this yeah there. In the within the house there was a partition which was from that wall to up to here then here there was door, this was bedroom and the other partition was sitting room within the sitting room, this was my bedroom so within the sitting room was fireplace so when you come into this immediately you come into my parents bedroom, this was fireplace, this was their bed place there was no space it was so small because it wasn’t an easy life it was hard life that was what they could afford so in other partition this was sitting room within the sitting room there we didn’t have chairs, we used to sit on the floor because on the mats sometimes they would spread like this and we would sit on it so when you come into our house this was the sitting room, our sitting room and they would spread this mat and you would come and sit down on the mat. And this was fireplace, my mother would cook mainly cooking was in my grandmothers’ house but because of because she was busy going to school and she wasn’t with us until she finished my grandmother. Main cooking was in my grandmother’s place which was within the house that time within the house so we would do the cooking in my grandmother’s house we’d eat when we’d wake up in the morning in the grandmother’s place she’d have prepared us breakfast we would eat, we would do house chores and then go out playing. Back at home this place was just for my grandmother grand for my parents and within my parents my parents would only keep us to sleep in their house until when they stopped breast feeding as soon as breast feeding was over it was the end to our grandmother. As soon as breast feeding was finished to our grandmother so during the time you are being breast fed is the only time that you can spend that time with your with my parents at nights. As soon as you are out of breast feeding then you start sleeping at my grandmother’s house, yes so it was only during breast feeding as soon as it was finished you would go to my grandmother’s house to sleep the sleeping starts at my grandmother’s house until when you grew up. so because of the house in the day time when you fall asleep and my grandmother had gone to the doing her normal work they would spread a mat like this on the floor for us in my parents sitting room and you would sleep, sometime you see children have a nap so when you’re three years two sometime you’d have a nap they’d spread it you sleep otherwise at night once you stop breast feeding you used to sleep at our grandmothers house. So at our grandmother’s house in the evening you would sit down around the fire, every evening there had a to be a fire a round fire where you sit around as a family you talk matters, this is where now you get the talk, you know what is going on they would teach you about how to cook, how to look after yourselves how to be good children they would be advising you at the round fire. On the round fire there’s a round fire for ladies with my grandmother which is by the fire for cooking there is another fire for my grandfather which is for boys so he would be teaching the boys about how to take care of cattle how to take care of themselves when they grow up and they become families look after your wife this way you need to build a house this way you need to do like my grandmother was. my grandfather after the missionary came he became a what do you call somebody who makes furniture?</p>
<p><em>Oh erm a furniture maker</em></p>
<p>Yeah he became a furniture maker that’s what he specialised in so he would teach them how to make furniture because people never used to know how to they never used to have furniture so it’s one of the he benefitted from when the missionaries came he became a furniture maker so he would teach my brothers how to make furniture. When missionaries first came they brought in they introduced the tools so my grandfather had a tool I remember it was a tool for cutting tree somebody would hold the other side the other one would hold the other side and you would be cutting a tree and that is what he specialised in so at the time in the day when the cattle are out in the field feeding because sometime the cattle would be left alone you would take them around, first of all in the morning you get them out of where you keep them you remove them then they take them to the field you be with them for some time until they settle, once they sell and they’re eating there’s no problem, you still have to leave rope on them you can’t leave them to roam or they’ll eat somebody’s crops so you still have to tie on the tree you tie with rope and you tie with the tree so that they cannot roam around and eat somebody’s destroy somebody’s crops so sometimes some of the cows can be wild because they used to have horns you can still have cows with horns so they could if one goes wild they can sometime how do you call it they can sometime</p>
<p><em>Attack?</em></p>
<p>Attack because cows sometime when they mate especially the bulls they attack each other, they’re like lions you know a male lion and a male lion they never meet, when they meet they always fight so bulls are the same. A bull from somebody else and from someone they never meet always when they meet they fight so you have to always tie you have to always tie a bull in case they happen to roam around, meet the other bull and start fight because they can fight to death yeah they always fight to death sometimes they fight XXXX and the intestine come out it can be that bad so my grandfather in the day after they’ve tied the cows, they’re down in the place, they’re feeding they would come back and he would teach them how to do the sawing. So during the time they’re doing the sawing they would teach them other things as men. They would teach them how to live with woman, they would teach them how to be faithful they would teach them how to look after XXXX. They would teach them how to be a man and be responsible. Grandmother while we are cooking because it was all cooking and I remember me growing up it was all garden work, doing work in the garden, back at home cooking, going to the market to go and exchange items like if you have cassava you would exchange it with potato. If I have a bag of corn I would exchange it with potato or if something else I exchange with somebody else so my grandmother would have gone to exchange. We don’t have oil and if somebody else had oil because they used to use the cow ghee we would exchange you go to the market and you walk around and there would be areas of this people who had brought ghee they sit in one area people who have brought cassava. We used to go with her in the market to go and exchange because that is how one day you learn to be a full woman who can look after herself so you would go with her and she would introduce us and she would say if you see oil with this you know it’s not good it’s not been properly done the person must have rushed it, if you see cassava which is like this this is not done. If you see maize that is like this that is not done so you must go around and check and see the one that is like this if you see it is like this you know it was nicely is properly is ready. So she would take us round and she’d teach us how to do that so when she was going to market we go with her and she would teach us, that was mainly on weekends because on week days you were going to school because the time you were going up school was very far, my school was about an hour and a half</p>
<p><em>Really and you had to walk?</em></p>
<p>I had to walk, I walk the whole of my life to school there was no where I had to and it was one and a half hours and I would come back for lunch we go to school in the morning walk one and a half hours in the morning to school, not even walk run you would run to school. Lunch time you would come back for lunch because my parents couldn’t afford to give us pack us lunch so you would come back give us lunch go back to school as normal, learn, come back in the evening. Coming back in the evening there’s work waiting for you so I used to have one two three four journeys every day. One and a half hours going, one and a half hours coming back one and a half hours going one and a half hours coming back. Every day, every day for seven years from the age of six to the age of twelve or thirteen.</p>
<p><em>So at what age did you finish school?</em></p>
<p>I finished school at the age of thirteen.</p>
<p><em>And what did you do then?</em></p>
<p>When I finished school I went to secondary school, that was primary, so when I finished I went to a different school that time schools were schools had come now there were schools in almost all of the places. So when I finished primary school walking was primary I walked to primary there were no a lot of schools at that time there were a few schools and the school I went to was a missionary school because my grandmother also believed in missionary so she would only suggest that you would go to that missionary school because it was a very good school you know to the standard of the area of education and of discipline was very very good in discipline so you would go to that school so I went to that school for seven years from standard one, we call it standard, so I finished at the age of thirteen, thirteen or fourteen then I joined secondary. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So discipline, was discipline really hard at school?</em></p>
<p>Discipline was very very hard and was first priority in school; I remember when you are going to school. When we sometime when we go to school I would be late and lateness would mean punishment, they never used to listen to any explanation lateness was punishment, punishment was you kneel down on the stones, rocks, which was meant as an area meant for punishment so you kneel down on the rocks for an hour or for half an hour depending on how late you are, how long or if it’s very very late you’d walk on the rocks on your knees, like this throughout the time. If you’re punished for an hour of for half hour you would be walking on your knees on the rock, besides that there was the school had a farm if you were late you would be put to work in the farm depending on how late you are you work in the farm while other students are in class. So tomorrow you will never be late [laughs] thinking about what you went through yesterday, you will make sure tomorrow you wake up very early in the morning and you don’t go through what you went through yesterday. So it was lesson learnt once anybody else will tell you I only got punished once I never got punished ever again.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever get punished?</em></p>
<p>I got punished, I got punished, I walked on the stones yes I walked on the stones there was a small small punishment which would be running around the building that was supposed to be we’d call it light punishment. So there was the building would be long like this one because it was a school with different classes so they would tell you the teacher would tell you run around the building five times non-stop so you would run around the building. Run around the building five times when you finish you come to class, that was light punishment another punishment was working in the school farm. School had farms by where we do agriculture so when the punishment depending on what you’ve done they’d send you to the farm and give you horse, the tools to work in farm depending on the work they want you to work to do in the farm then you’d work they’d tell you work for one hour in the farm or work for two hours or half an hour or forty five minutes or twenty minutes in the farm so when you finish working in the farm you come to the teacher, you apologise and then you go to class. Every punishment when you’re done you apologise and you go to class.</p>
<p><em>What did you do after secondary school?</em></p>
<p>When I finished secondary school I had nothing, completely I had nothing I went to the city to try and get, because my dad by that time had retired.</p>
<p><em>What did your dad do?</em></p>
<p>My dad was a teacher so by the time I finished secondary school he had retired. Because my dad because of education came late he started going to school very late in his life so because there was no education they used to look after cattle they used to help their dads they used to help at home so when education came and it was not like today when I am twenty I can refuse that time even if you were thirty and they tell you to start nursery you have no say, you go to school. So you find at the age of my father so many people went to school late but they managed to catch up but at the time of retirement you still had to retire even if you’ve only worked for two years. Retirement time was retirement time you had to retire.</p>
<p><em>How old was that?</em></p>
<p>Retirement during my father’s time is fifty years. So my father retired at the time I finished school he retired, it was fifty years not fifty five I think they’ve raised it now to fifty five. So my father retired so there was nothing much so when I grew up I grew up to look after myself it was now my time, my turn to look after because it was like your dad’s time was to bring you up do his part at a certain stage it was your turn so it was my turn when I got to that level finished secondary it was my turn. So my turn means I had to go out there and start looking after myself. So I went to the city just out of nowhere I went to the city, started from nowhere started by living in a very small house then I started working, I was working in a second hand market whereby I started by picking, picking clothes in the market, in the open market. There’s a market whereby they sell clothes come from abroad and I don’t know they sell them somewhere you know for people to survive so I would go in the evening, I would go in the market and pick some people would sort their clothes the ones they think cannot sell they would throw so people who’d want to start a living and surviving would go there it was an opportunity for them to go there and pick, you pick you choose and put together sometimes you go and iron and when you iron it changes their faces and then when the faces change somebody else would be lucky and somebody else would be nice and then you’d start selling at a cheap price. So I went and I started picking and I would pick, like was not as difficult as it is today, today I don’t think you can do that and survive. So I would pick, go in the market in the evening when because in the day time you have to pay for tax there’s payment of tax. Everyone who is selling within the market you have to pay tax so because I can’t afford to pay tax, I’ve only come in the city I’m just beginning you take advantage of evening when the tax collector is gone. [laughs] we shouldn’t be laughing! When the tax collector is gone so because you can’t afford and you need to pay your rent you need to eat you need to survive so I go in the evening when the tax collector has gone and I stand and pick pick pick pick pick they’re all over the market before the cleaners come and clean out to take them for recycling or take them away for dumping you pick pick pick pick pick pick pick put in a bag go home iron so when you iron tomorrow and when the tax collector is gone you stand on the side of the market and then you sell for passers by people who have come from work so if you’re lucky you will find somebody, god will send someone and will buy from me so when they buy from you when you sometime you get lucky and everything is sold because you sell them at the cheapest throw away price because all you need is milk and bread, that’s all you need and maybe sugar just for the day you don’t want to think about tomorrow. You just survive for the day so you go and sell, as long as you come out of there with milk, with sugar or as long as you come out of there bread you know you have food. You go home, you set aside a bit for your rent because rent was keep. You set aside some for the rent, sometimes you share a place it’s just a room you share as long as you find a place to put your head the next day you wake up and you survive so you do that and I did that and then as I did that I promoted myself. The small small bits added up with added up and now I promoted myself to be able to sit in the market where the tax collector is so I would be able to pay my tax I would be able to sell, buy a bale of a bag of clothes, open my own bill and sell. So I started surviving on that so I would sell I would start selling as I sold then I joined a college joined secretarial college so I did secretarial college two years paying out of this so as I went along I employed someone to look after to sell for me so all I would do is I would know the price of the bale which I know would be for example would be like in terms of pounds would be thirty pounds or forty pound or fifty pound which is a lot of money so I know that is the price so from that price I estimate that this would be the profit so this lady who I employed would sell so the lady would go for the bale very early in the morning in the store in the warehouse get the bale and I say today go for blouses today go for skirts. This season is the skirts going, this season it’s the dresses going, this season it is shoes this season it’s jumpers this season is.. you have to catch up to know at that time what is really selling depending on the when it’s like for example when it’s winter time, which is not as bad as here, you know what is selling just like England in the shops when it is winter time the shoppers know what is selling, if you sell sleeveless during winter. Stupid. So that’s what we do as well in the market this season these clothes will sell, this season is tops this season jumpers so you have to be catching up to bags just like the shoes like that you you’ll be guiding this person coordinating, how was it? Oh I went at a loss. Are you sure? Make sure that receipts are there that she writes down everything so that went on, I went to secretarial for two years, I did my secretarial for two years I finished. When I finished selling was still going on because that was my only way for survival it was still going on as normal so I promoted myself with a computer so computer I didn’t do for long but I did for six months, I did for only six months then I did computer and I wanted to know I got a few certificates for work processing and doing this and doing that so I got the basic. Because at that time doing secretarial when I did I got short hand and doing short hand was coming out of fashion unless you did becoming personal secretary to so and so which was not easy to get that level especially in my position. So it was pointless. At that computers were becoming common in offices the old type-writers was going they were starting to introduce the electrical which was starting to be in fashion so I went for computer because the old computer system the very old one was going out of fashion so I had to try and catch up so I did the secretarial and I did the computer I went to computer classes so that I would catch up with the latest system. So that went on, it went on and then after that I ventured into I ventured into car business so I stopped the business of clothes was now going down and besides that my money was, one day I was pick pocketed I went back to see how I could expand it unfortunately in the warehouse I don’t even know how my money was pick pocketed and that was the end of the story, that is how my business of market ending so I stopped that is how the story of the market ended so I stopped I end the other lady, that lady also started her own business from back there she picked up herself and she started doing business and I think she’s still in the market up until today. So I got into business of a car, to transport, I got a cheap transport and started doing transport so I did school transport which was I was doing uh school children getting them from school back to home picking them from home taking them to various schools then it didn’t do well because life was changing and parents were becoming a bit it was getting difficult for parent so they would suggest children to walk to school so business went down so I stopped so when I stopped I now went into selling vegetables whereby I had to sell vegetables so I started selling vegetables while I looked for a job, I looked for a job I did everything and I never got a job in my secretarial. I think it was just not meant to be it was not mine so I looked for a job and it didn’t work so I ventured into vegetable business and because I was having children. I was having children at that time. I was looking after my children from this business, the leftover we would eat the fruit which had not sold we would eat we would bring it at home. The food that was ran out of date we would bring home and my children would eat. I was paying my rent, my children’s school. At that time the presidents and there was school education so children went to school and all of this and that and then in the process I met my husband. We met, we communicated and then he proposed and then we got married and that’s how I came to England.</p>
<p><em>So did you get married in….</em></p>
<p>I got married in Kenya</p>
<p><em>Did he go out there?</em></p>
<p>He came out; he’s been out there to Kenya</p>
<p>This is Kenya, this is the lake we grew up near that lake this is lake Victoria so that is him in Kenya and this is where I grew up in XXXX where I am born we are on the equator, right on the equator so this is where my village home. So he wanted, he couldn’t believe when I told him I am brought up on the equator so he said I will have to go and see for myself.</p>
<p><em>We need to borrow that at some point </em></p>
<p>You? You need this one?</p>
<p><em>Yeah for the exhibition</em></p>
<p>Really? I’m going to take proper photos when I go home yes, I have some of them and this is the equator</p>
<p><em>That’s amazing</em></p>
<p>So I took him and he said I have to climb on top of the equator, it’s about seven minutes from our home this is where I am brought up. If you need a proper picture I will take when I go home</p>
<p><em>Do please. We need it for the exhibition</em></p>
<p>I’ll take photos</p>
<p><em>That’s lovely.</em></p>
<p><em>so how did you meet him?</em></p>
<p>I met him through someone, I met my husband through someone and we communicated and then he travelled over to Kenya and then we met each other and then we knew each other and we communicated and then did our wedding.</p>
<p><em>Did you get married in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>Yeah we got married in Kenya so this is Lake Victoria. This is the historical lake, this is the lake where I am born.</p>
<p><em>It’s beautiful</em></p>
<p>This is the village where I am born on the equator.</p>
<p><em>So how long ago did you come over then?</em></p>
<p>I came in 2007 in September 2007. That’s when I got my visa and then I came over so since that time I’ve been here. Three years so that’s how I ended up here.</p>
<p><em>So where do your mother and father live? Do they still live in the village?</em></p>
<p>My father and my mother the rest of their lives have lived in the village. My mother only came to live in town because of my children. When I was coming to England I had no choice but I had to leave my children with someone so I had to leave my, I spoke to my mum I brought her over to town and she’s living with my children even as I am talking, she’s the one taking care of my children. So she lives in the village not because of anything because she is looking after my children the whole of her life since she was born she’s never lived in the city she’s only lived in the village. My dad lived in the village until he died, my father died in 2004 on Christmas day, he went to bed and he never woke up he had a heart problem. So he went to sleep and he never woke up the following day he went in his sleep on Christmas Day 2004. So we don’t have a dad, I only have my mum.</p>
<p><em>Are all of your brothers and sisters still in Kenya?</em></p>
<p>My brothers and sisters we were in a family of eight and four of us have died and four are alive. So in the family number one is dead, number three is dead, number five is dead, number seven is dead. All of the odd numbers are gone and in a short space of time so it’s left number two, number four which is me, number six and number eight the other odd numbers are all gone so we were a family of five boys and three girls. Two girls are gone I’m the only girl left and two boys are gone only three boys left in the family of boys only three left so out of eight we are only four left the other four are gone. One went last year, the one I XXXX went last year. So we are only the left the four with my mother.</p>
<p><em>So you said your grandmother used to tell you stories? </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Do you remember any of those stories?</em></p>
<p>Yes I remember the stories yes.</p>
<p><em>Can you tell me your favourite one?</em></p>
<p>Uh the favourite one was about a girl, a very beautiful girl very very beautiful girl who was admired by everyone. Men, woman, animals, birds everything. Everybody was admiring this girl she was the most beautiful ever seen and the beauty of the girl was she was so much beautiful that she was never allowed to go out, out of the house because they were afraid of somebody grabbing her and she was called XXXX, XXXX was her name so because she was so beautiful her parents never allowed her to go out because everyone would want to grab her animal would want to grab her human being wanted to grab her and she had a sister, the sister was called Aween (?) so what happened during the time, every time the parent wanted something, the parents were so protective over XXXX so every time the parent wanted something they wouldn’t send XXXX because of her beauty they didn’t want to expose XXXX to the world she was a girl who was kept in the house twenty four seven because of her beauty, they were worried of losing her because of her beauty so every time the parents wanted something from the market they would send the sister of XXXX, Aween so one day the birds. In the morning when the parents woke up the birds would be, they had a very very big tree besides the house very very very big tree very old big tree so when the parents woke up they’d find different kinds of birds waiting to see XXXX just to see the beauty and admire wanting to admire XXXX because she was so beautiful. So because of that the parents decided to send Aween the sister of XXXX to the market so anything to do with XXXX if anyone wanted to talk to XXXX the sister was the one to coordinate. If you wanted to talk to XXXX or if by any chance you wanted to marry XXXX it was Aween to coordinate so the birds would spend twenty four hours from all sorts of lives to come and see XXXX everyone was trying their luck to see XXXX and to marry XXXX, animals, human being and birds. So who was going to be the winner, who was going to win. XXXX as beautiful she was ready for anyone or anything but as long as she decided to choose something because in that big tree there was the most beautiful having the sweetest fruit ever. What happened XXXX said anyone who would not eat the fruit from that tree will marry me, I will marry any bird, human or animal eat fruit from that tree that is the test, that is the interview. If they happen to even taste I will never marry them so what I will say because they demand because my demand is so high that is the test I can put so my sister be my witness so one day the sister set off to the market because of communication to the market they couldn’t send XXXX to the market and that time the fruit were beautiful and the tree was all red, blooming with fruit, blooming with beautiful and the fruit was so sweet you could not afford to not eat it, it was so sweet that you couldn’t afford the temptation was so high that everyone would just say that I want to marry XXXX but the moment you see the fruit you just say ‘oh let me just eat a little’ and that is the end of it you fail the test so one day XXXX sister the dad and the mum didn’t want to get involved so XXXX sister was going out to the market and on getting out of the house she realised the tree the birds were flocked on the tree, millions and thousands and millions of birds so she was shocked and she came back and told XXXX, there’s so many birds, so many birds and then she said ‘can you go and see them? What kind of birds’ she went and said different, all kinds of birds I’ve seen them there’s all sorts of birds so XXXX says what can I do and the birds have come for you, what can we do? Then she started singing the older sister started singing [sings in Luo] which means that go and check for me which bird it is, if that bird happened to taste or eat the fruit then tell them to leave, to go which means they’ve failed the test. So the sister came out and found that the birds were feeding, they couldn’t stand the temptation, they were feeding on the fruits. Feeding on the fruits they couldn’t stand the temptation was too high so she came back to XXXX and said I’ve seen this bird for example pigeon I’ve seen pigeon, pigeon is eating very very busy eating one by one they came back what of what do you call the birds just any bird</p>
<p><em>Sparrow</em></p>
<p>The sparrow is now one of the ones that is eating, okay I think because inside XXXX there’s the birds she was hoping for so those are the ones she was interested in. what of the crow? Crow is even worse. So the song would go on, they were talking in song it was the same song it was the song of sun. What of about this bird is eating? What of this one? This one is eating. What of this one? Is eating. Then they say go back after checking and checking and go back and find if this bird is eating the she came and said no, it’s flocked somewhere and it’s not. This bird is not. She said wait and find somewhere and make sure that you look properly all the birds are eating the fruit except I’ve looked and I’ve seen that this bird is not eating, she said go somewhere and take your time and make sure that this bird is not eating. So she looked and said no, it’s not. So she looked and waited for some time and XXXX went and hid somewhere because she was so beautiful she was not allowed to be see so XXXX looked through that space and she said ‘it’s not eating’ then XXXX sent the sister and said go an buy my wedding dress because I can only marry him [laughs] so XXXX gave the sisters son [sings in Luo] so it said go out and tell this bird to wait for me, so the sister went out and saw the bird, told the bird that XXXX said that you wait, she’s going to marry you so the sister went away and brought the wedding dress, I don’t know whether used to be there at that time and the sister came and XXXX married this bird and they finally went so the temptation was to the fruits in XXXX home. It was such a big big tree bearing so many fruits and XXXX decided what can I do because my demand is so high the only thing I can do is to put temptation, everyone who be tempted to eat that fruit I will not marry but anyone who will not eat the fruit is the person I will propose to and I will marry so XXXX got married to this bird which didn’t eat the fruit so they went. I could tell you in proper way if you know I would tell you but it’s a long story so you record it in a proper, proper way one by one then you can have it in a proper way</p>
<p><em>That’s lovely</em></p>
<p>So XXXX was finally married by a by this bird, I don’t know what to call it in English but I will ask, I will ask the way I could call it in English so XXXX was finally married, finally married the bird and they went</p>
<p><em>And you’re going back to Kenya at Christmas are you? </em></p>
<p>I’m going back to Kenya at Christmas and I’ve spoken to my mother there’s some traditional items that I’m going to come back with, I’ve done orders so I’m going to come back with like when Luos start dancing they use the tail of a cow, how do you call it, you know the tail of a cow</p>
<p><em>Cow tail</em></p>
<p>Yeah cow tail. They use it for dancing you know for so I’m going to bring that. I’ve done orders so that when we’re going to be dancing we are going to be dancing with that, I know how to dance with it</p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p><em>We’ll have to video you doing it</em></p>
<p>Yeah we’ll dance in Ilford then we used to dance in XXXX skirts so I’ve ordered for XXXX skirts I’m going to bring them back when I come I’m going to order for how do you call them</p>
<p><em>Head dress?</em></p>
<p>Yeah hat, is it called head dress? A hat that they used to wear when it was dancing like when it was party time, alcohol party or ceremonial when somebody had died and they were celebrating their death so I’ve ordered that. I hope I don’t have a problem when I at the migration airport</p>
<p><em>No you shouldn’t</em></p>
<p>No they shouldn’t so I’ve ordered for that, I’ve ordered for this drum, drum is here. That’s the Luo drum. Then this is the Luo</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that beautiful</em></p>
<p><em>[Banging on a drum]</em></p>
<p><em>What’s it called?</em></p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p><em>It’s beautiful </em></p>
<p>Then there’s this one here, this is what the when the Luo used to spear themselves during war time this is a shield but because I couldn’t buy a big one so that’s a shield. When they’re fighting somebody’s trying to hit you or spear you</p>
<p><em>Yeah that’s what you cover yourself with</em></p>
<p>Yeah cover yourself with so when they spear it would spear this. That was the defence. Sometime you just carry it for when there’s dancing you just use it for when there’s dancing depending on why people are dancing but it’s for protection when you’re fighting</p>
<p><em>So I’m going to stop that now.</em></p>
