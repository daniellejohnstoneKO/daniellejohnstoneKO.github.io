<p>Ask me, my date of birth did you say?</p>
<p><em>Yeah I’ll ask you that in a second, if it’s ok, I’ll just put that erm…oh if I just sit that on there, cos then that’s…that’s facing you then. Ok so this is Claire Days interviewing Mrs Tingey for the Barking Park Oral History Project, on the…5<sup>th</sup> of September 2011. So could ask you to say your full name and date of birth please?</em></p>
<p>17<sup>th</sup> of January 1918, I think it makes me ninety four</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] and what’s your full name please?</em></p>
<p>Iris Tingey, I was a Miss Clement, my father was very well known in the town</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>There was no…I doubt there was anybody else at that period left in Barking, because we have got so many new people, I very much doubt, if there’s any people of my period left here, so many have moved away.</p>
<p><em>Of course</em></p>
<p>Mmh</p>
<p><em>And where were you born?</em></p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Erm, I wrote it all down in case I forgot</p>
<p><em>Oh right ok [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Erm in Barking, and lots of people wouldn’t know it, it’s facing the railway, and our house was the only one in the road, and it was could Loxford house, Loxford Road, just off the Victoria road, Barking, that was on the boarders of Barking and Ilford, erm…yes we lived there until dad built our houses up at XXXX gardens from that block of Shirley gardens to Lyndhurst on the Longbridge road…he was the only builder in those days and we moved in there from Loxford house where I born into Longbridge road when I was fourteen,…and then erm…one of my…more important jobs was working for the government in war room during the war, forty feet underground,…but I'm not telling you where it was…</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Is it still a secret?</em></p>
<p>It was yes, we were sworn to secrecy, it might be used again, I think, sometime later, never know, erm so dad was a builder, the only one I think in Barking when I was a child and we moved into Longbridge Road when I was fourteen and Barking was very different then, very different…when we were children we used to walk along Longbridge road here into Upney Lane and Upney Lane was a Lane with hedges, believe it or not, there were four lovely little cottages left, I doubt if they’re still there, I doubt it, they were opposite the entrance to the hospital, four original old cottages at the foot of the station hill, which is Upney station., and it was right…these cottages were right opposite the hospital entrance and of course that’s all changed, it’s all houses now, isn’t it? Very different from when I was a child, and we’d walk along here on a Sunday afternoon four children…and the other two left home, cos I was the eldest…and we’d walk down Upney Lane which was a Lane as I say and the original Lane was behind Upney Lane and it was hedges and then they made a road there really to go over the station and also…when the hospital was built, but erm…no times have changed, ties have changed. I just can’t believe I’m ninety-four</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>When I got to eighty, I thought oh it’s near the end of my life, what do I want to do? But I’m still here at ninety-four and I have five lovely grandchildren…and erm the youngest one has settled in Japan, marrying a Japanese girl, they got married last Christmas…yes I’ve got one granddaughter and four grandsons, I’m…very grateful and my granddaughter called yesterday, with her mum, she’s moved over to the other side of the river…it’s nearer London where she’s moved, somewhere near Black Heath, nearer to London I think she said and…they live Lyndhurst gardens, so she’s nearer London where she’s moved, but god she’s...coming up thirty/thirty-one now I can’t believe that</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] when you think of her do you still imagine her to be a small child?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes…erm Frank’s around somewhere erm…yes tomorrow I’ve got…a gentleman coming about my ears I think it is yes ears…</p>
<p><em>Right ok can you remember what schools you went to in the area</em></p>
<p>Yes, I…went to North Street School</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Which they changed later on to Northbury school…its where the church road bridge is, you go down an alleyway, but we lived at Loxford house, so we were the other side and the railway came in front…not near the house we had a field opposite and a big high wall but when you’re upstairs you could see the railway and the trains and…when we weren’t well as children, small children, mum would let us go and sit and look out the window, we’d sit by the window believe it or not…and the trains, the steam trains used to XXXX up and down there, it was like a siding and mum would give us a bit of paper and a pen [Laughs] and we’d write all the numbers of the engines, just for us to do something when we were getting over measles or one of those children’s illnesses…</p>
<p><em>Did you enjoy that?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes we enjoyed, we had a lovely…lovely home life, mum was a dear she was a…a country girl Great Leigh’s n Essex, but my dad came down at ten years old from Dundee, so how they met, I will never know [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] so why did your mother moved London…to the Barking area, do you know?</em></p>
<p>Yes, when they…they were in the farming business…when they were children, they’re parents were Great Leigh’s, Essex, it’s lovely countryside down there and…she moved, I think she was about ten when they moved to Beckton…and they had a little cottage there and I think they’ve been pulled down now…I think so but there were about four or six of them and they lived there with the family, at…it up at a high slope, and I think it was a coal…huge lumps of coal on the way to Woolwich…I doubt, they’re probably all built on now, there were huge areas of coal and coke on the corner and then they built the bypass at the back there…yes times have changed</p>
<p><em>Did you have any brothers or sisters?</em></p>
<p>Yes I had three sisters…and two brothers, my eldest sister went to Australia with her family and then 19’…1969 or ’70 I went out to visit her and I was so thrilled because, and I think she was too, bless her…she was ten years older than me, and I went I was about 69 or 70 and she was very ill, it was most unfortunate, but I felt I had to go, it was very strange, but I couldn’t get a sailing date and that was October I had this letter from her daughter saying mother wasn’t very well, that’s all I knew, but I felt I had to go…and they’ve had been out there twenty years, and we both cuddled one other and cried, and I stayed with them a fortnight then I went to…live with somebody else, another relation that went out there, and I was away from Barking for fourteen months…I was so glad I went cos I was only there very short…matter of weeks when my sister passed away…she was a dear, she really was, and she loved all wildlife like myself and I’ve belonged to the…RSPCA….birds RSPB, I belonged to them for years now, I think I must have been one of the first people that joined to dear old Bill Oddie, I think it was in those days, I think he was the head of the birds then, it was to do with wildlife, I watched all wildlife, always…and we always had two dogs when I was a child, when in the house and one outside, dad having a builders yard you can imagine we needed someone to keep an eye on all the timber and bricks that were brought in…in the back…of the house, and the house got a direct hit I understand during the war and erm…they’ve rebuilt it, somebody took me round there a few years ago now and every building…was nothing, nothing like…our old house was, nothing at all, but anyway, erm, mother would have been in that house but she had gone round shopping to Charlie XXXX green grocer, everybody knew Charlie, lovely family, Charlie XXXX, and mother had gone round to get some fruit and vegetables, otherwise, she wouldn’t have been here, the bomb dropped in the erm…tributary of the roading was at the side of the house…and the bomb dropped in the…bank of the river, well it was a tributary of the roading so it wasn’t wide, but it was quite wide when it’s at the side of the house and the bomb dropped in the mud on the bank at the side of the house, the house was shattered, it had to be rebuilt, had to pull it down and mother had just gone shopping round at Charlie XXXX, that was a wonderful, wonderful day for all the family, and erm I had gone up to Retford then with the baby, my baby, that was erm…oh about ’41 I went up there 1941, because the bombing started here and that’s when my parents said oh get out of Barking and my sister was already lived at Retford, cos her husband was in the army up there, so she got me someone to stay with, right near her and we used to go out with both our babies in the…the prams that we’d hired up there cos we couldn’t take them on the train, but erm I was up there fourteen months yes, but oh so glad it was mum that drew me back, and of course when I got back to Barking, we had four guns opposite here, four…</p>
<p><em>And that’s Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>In the park, yes opposite</p>
<p><em>Do you describe them?</em></p>
<p>Well they built I think a cricket changing building, this is the swimming pool I can see, they had just painted a big wall, all cream…I think it’s the swimming pool that was there, yeah making good use of it I hear</p>
<p><em>They are yes</em></p>
<p>That’s good, because it was a waste, we use to go there when it first opened…and erm…they had two beautiful fountains either end they really were beautiful and I was told…erm that was the largest swimming pool in London and then Wembley bought one to beat us, by about a couple of feet I think it was [Laughs] but we were at first the largest open aired swimming pool in England…or at least in London, I don’t think are any…outside…open aired one built that time I don’t think s, but it was a lovely pool, and it was deep in the middle nine foot six and then it graduated down to about two foot six either end but it was massive, really massive, so I’m glad their making use of it, so someone I think it was in the paper about it, I think…but erm no when I think when we used to walk Sunday afternoon down Upney Lane…and we’d walk down Upney Lane into Ripple Road, turn right at the bottom there into Ripple Road and then we’d go all thorough the town and back to Loxford house</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>By then we were worn out being young children [Laughs] and my father used to put the baby, who was only about three or four, my dear brother who died, he was a baby of the family, so there were four girls… I’m pressing on it…there were four girls and two boys…time I got used to this…I had another one first of all and it wasn’t as big as this, but my daughter saw them advertised…and she phoned or did something and a man came down and brought this and it was so much, better then the little one I had, which I filled then, it wasn’t wide enough for a big person, because I sleep in here and I have done now for over five years, night and day…I don’t sleep normally in the day, but erm if I got out of bed I just couldn’t get back, because I have to lift this right leg and I had to get in on the left leg and this leg I couldn’t lift off the floor, so that’s why I stayed in the chair, it’s very comfortable I must say that and I can go full out, just my head up slightly, so that’s alright, I’m lucky</p>
<p><em>Yeah that sound quite good [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yes dear old Frank…he never had any children and he lost his wife…at fifty-eight…and I knew him slightly thorough the Barking historical…and erm…then we met at the shops…sounds like a trumped up story but it was the fish shop, we met in the fish shop, the wet fish shop…on the…the left side of Upney Lane as you…one of the last shops I think…yes it’s next door to the chemist isn’t it on Upney Lane…and that’s where I met him…and he said ‘I thought you’d gone to Australia’ I said ‘I did, but I came back’ [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And erm we had a small chat, I said ‘I must go, I’ve got someone coming home’ and I erm just think I wanted to get away I don’t know why, he’s so kind and it was only thorough Barking Historical, I knew him slightly, he was erm…the one who started it</p>
<p><em>Mmh ok</em></p>
<p>Barking historical…yes he’s erm ninety-four last…April…</p>
<p><em>Can you remember the very first time that you went to the lido?</em></p>
<p>When it first opened dear, when it first opened, I should I think I was thirteen or fourteen…and people use to come from London down it was the only open aired pool, so big and the fountains were lovely, I’m wondering if they’ve crumbled by now</p>
<p><em>Erm I can actually tell you, they’ve actually preserved the fountains</em></p>
<p>They have?</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Oh good</p>
<p><em>So they’re still in there</em></p>
<p>Oh cos they were lovely, they were lovely, and it’s very big isn’t it, if you’ve been over there</p>
<p><em>Oh of course</em></p>
<p>Very big pool</p>
<p><em>Erm unfortunately the pool’s no longer there, because they’ve dug that out and they’re going to have a wet play area for children</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s good</p>
<p><em>So it’s so much a pool anymore, but there’s sort of a you know wet area they can play and paddle</em></p>
<p>They used to have one like that a play area and it was concrete and it filled with a little water, right next door to the left of the pool, what happened to that?</p>
<p><em>Erm I don’t think that’s there anymore unfortunately</em></p>
<p>Oh got rid of it, yes, well it wasn’t used much. If I went over the park with the dog, there was no children in that pool ever, very, very seldom…and having a dog…cos I was at work and as soon as I came home from the town hall, I was in the education department…and then I ‘d take the dog over the park, but there was…any old days when it first opened they’d be queuing up to get in the pool, it was really lovely, really lovely and until they, until they built I think it was Wembley, I’m sure it was…and erm that was the biggest one in London, in London or it might have been in England, or even in Europe, but it was lovely, it really was and I know, my daughter who is now sixty-two [Laughs] I took her over there when she was four and she was petrified at first and we were in the shallow end, I think it was two foot six or something and she was about four, so of course she was frightened so…I didn’t force her to back, she didn’t like it, so we came home, but there were always crowds of people over there, I don’t them, the only one in London at that time…yes you know the houses, you go that way walking sometimes, from Shirley to Lyndhurst, dad built that block and the one of the corner of Shirley, he built for a doctor XXXX who was a doctor in Upton Park and…and that was very, very, very sad…it got a direct hit and his wife and doctor were both killed…very sad and then of course the house next door caught alight, with the explosion and four out of dad’s six houses, there were six in XXXX six houses and then the big double fronted house, he did and sold two, he was building for someone, he didn’t own the ground, I forgotten who it was and I think it might have been Mr Blake if he was still around cos he was the man in Barking Arthur Blake at that time…</p>
<p><em>Why was he the man in Barking? Why was he so well known?</em></p>
<p>Blake?</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>Erm…I think he brought lots of properties</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And he’s erm…what was it called…his offices were over the clocktower…when…that was a terrible shock…the night…I think it was in the April, the terrible bombing in Barking, terrible bombing and the clocktower that dad built got a direct hit and the shops around it went down, but some of them are still there I’ve been told…well cos I know East Street, I don’t know if the roundabout cuts the top out, does it? East Street?</p>
<p><em>Erm</em></p>
<p>Used to be Dunes on one corner and Boots on the other corner and he built, it wasn’t boots when dad did it, it was another firm, big grocers and there was always the gas company in the Ripple Road side and round the corner I think there were four which lovely…lovely bays and they were dad’s as well, he built when that place on the corner with the clock on the top, I think it had three floors and then the clocktower and that got a direct hit, wasn’t that unfortunate…to have…I’m sure it wasn’t for that, that they, they were aiming, I’ve think probably for the guns here…that’s what I think and we had a terrible night and mum and dad said ‘you must get away with the baby’ and my sister was already in Retford, so of course she found me somewhere to stay, and it was very nice, we hired prams by the month [Laughs] well we didn’t know how long we’d be staying, then in the end we brought them…well we couldn’t take a big pram on the train could we? When I think back, I had the baby five months in my arms and a big case cos I had to have clothes for both of us, for hot and cold weather, I don’t know how I did it now, when I think back, it was an effort wasn’t? Big case and I was away fourteen months…when I came back it got worse…it got worse with the four guns opposite, they were huge guns?</p>
<p><em>Could you talk a little bit about that, like what would it have been like when they went off?</em></p>
<p>Dreadful, the house shook [Laughs] when they came over the top we got…the rebound I expect you’d call it…but being old well built houses, this block…they were built by Mr Garbett G-A-R-B-E-T-T…and he was also the builder that built the…erm asylum at Barkingside on the top of the hill</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>He built that big building. We went there once, with the XXXX to go over it, and it had just been closed and there was just a few inmates left, not many, but it was a lovely building, a lovely building and that was Jim Garbett. Here’s Frank.</p>
<p><em>Hello, how are you?</em></p>
<p>Frank: Hello</p>
<p><em>You ok?</em></p>
<p>Frank: more or less</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] it’s nice to see you again anyway</em></p>
<p>Frank: XXXX as one can expect</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank I think you’d be better on the settee dear, I’d think you’ll be better over there dear</p>
<p>Frank: over here</p>
<p>On the settee</p>
<p>Frank: there</p>
<p>Well unless</p>
<p><em>Would you like to sit here?</em></p>
<p>Frank: ...I’ll see how I get on, if I can understand my wife...then I’ll be able to move so quick, otherwise I’ll have to, suspend her, and...carry on myself</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: how...far to...memory is different from mine, so you may gain</p>
<p>Frank be careful, be careful...mind...mind her bag</p>
<p><em>Do you want me to move it?</em></p>
<p>I don’t want him to trip over</p>
<p><em>That’s ok; I’ll move it for you. There you go</em></p>
<p>Thanks dear</p>
<p><em>I shouldn’t have left it there</em></p>
<p>You’re not there yet Frank, you’re not there yet, don’t sit down yet, go back</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: XXXX prepare for me</p>
<p><em>You all ok now? [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>He’s alright, once he’s sitting down he’s alright</p>
<p>Frank: if you don’t speak up both of you, I shan’t be able to appreciate what you’re saying</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] well I’m quite load so you should be able to hear me [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>It was a lovely house, and I think it’s still there, on the corner of XXXX, it lays back</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And it’s another one of dad’s houses, he built for Mr Blake, and it was known as Blake’s house, it’s a lovely house, I understand it’s in Flats now, or it was, and he called it Faircross Lodge...well this was known as the Faircross, this area wasn’t Frank? This area was known as the Faircross.</p>
<p>Frank: what?</p>
<p>This area, and then they called that...school down here Faircross School for the invalid children...</p>
<p>Frank: I think I better sit over there</p>
<p>Would you like to sit here, and I’ll sit there...is that...is that better, I’ll swap sits with you? [Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>Move the XXXX, that’s a new cushion my daughter brought, but we’re not using it at the moment...</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>Cos...Too high I think for Frank</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>Frank weren’t you about ten when you came to Barking? Sit down...weren’t you about ten when you came to Barking from East Ham?</p>
<p>Frank: eleven</p>
<p>Eleven</p>
<p>Frank: I had just failed the eleven plus examination</p>
<p>Oh yes</p>
<p>Frank: so that mean I was eleven</p>
<p>Yes and he...</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>You tell the lady, anyway he was sent to Hart modern school...but he was too clever for the class, so they sent him to the Abbey</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Frank: that’s not true you see</p>
<p>Yes it is</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: you better let me speak</p>
<p>Yes dear</p>
<p>Frank: Thank you</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: no, I had very bad health when I was young, early school and I was just catching up...when two things happened...one I could suddenly read and two...erm what was the second one...have to quicker than this...erm...I sat the eleven plus...did I just say that?...did I say...</p>
<p><em>You sat the eleven plus</em></p>
<p>Frank: and I failed that, which was unfortunate, but when I gone off...and we came to Barking and moved into Shirley gardens, into a house that was just one year old...and I was sent automatically as I had not gained anything to Ripple Road school...which was a very nice school, and it was a single storey building, you’ll probably find out...and erm I was there for six weeks...XXXX</p>
<p><em>What sorry?</em></p>
<p>Frank: A tiger trap</p>
<p><em>A tiger trap?</em></p>
<p>Frank: this is to...I’d cleared out all the scribbles for the abbey or part of the schools cos...one year old and erm...I was there to...had any hope, they didn’t want to do much and they couldn’t do much, and I was there for six weeks and then about half a dozen places became available at the Hart modern school for the failures, see what they could do...and I was one of them, I’m not going not tell you the little ends of what happened</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: cos that’s XXXX, so Hart school...starting off six weeks behind the rest, I wasn’t even taught to play rugby, I was left to pick up</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: and I was there...I enjoyed it cos it was a new school, new people; I used to be...XXXX</p>
<p><em>Oh course</em></p>
<p>Frank: XXXX headmaster, was a real...vivid character, we called him old XXXX, cos he’d go on the XXXX he was nearly sixty, and he’d go out on the pitch and play rugby with the big boys…XXXX…take on whatever came, which I found XXXX…sometimes I didn’t…so…XXXX towards this was 1949 XXXX you left me XXXX fighting up towards 1951 and XXXX we were introduced to…I’m not sure XXXX a teacher or a specialist, who came XXXX and taught them, that we were going to have a pageant under the presence of Mr XXXX</p>
<p><em>XXXX</em></p>
<p>Frank: who was going to be…XXXX and as time went on, we had visitations for XXXX…educational people…teachers XXXX because we hadn’t got much money and we’d have to create all our clothes and XXXX things ourselves</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Frank: XXXX, for instance helmets were felt hats, ladies didn’t buy and they were plastered in aluminium paint…armour effect…and also we were told how to make round XXXX about twenty inches diameter, XXXX and again…they would be painted in rough XXXX rough Anglo-Saxon XXXX for XXXX…and then we had rehearsals in the school yard, which was quite…there was a large field round the school…XXXX and then coming up XXXX…to meet, what was the road…the bottom, where the hart modern school entrance is? Do you remember?...bottom of the Hart modern?</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p>Frank: bottom of the Hart modern where the ground come out and meet…erm…</p>
<p>What was the other school</p>
<p>Frank: no it wasn’t…that was XXXX and XXXX Avenue</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Frank: no this was just within the XXXX…</p>
<p>Where dear?</p>
<p>Frank: near the XXXX [Laughs]</p>
<p>Near the steps, pre-XXXX</p>
<p>Frank: Pre-XXXX, where they taught the pre-XXXX</p>
<p>Oh it was at the invalid children school, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Frank: no that was opposite the other side of the road</p>
<p>No in the same road, yes they moved it and built a new one Dagenham I believe</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>Frank: anyway we had…to rehearse our parts and we were given sheets, XXXX sheets, so we knew for instance. I think we were scene four, this was scene of Barking, right up to present day almost, or before 1914, anyway, and erm…we were…rehearse most XXXX but then we got to a larger scale of where the arena was…now the arena was in the centre of…Barking…simple XXXX open space, I’m going by [Crash]</p>
<p><em>You ok with that, oh ok [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I think that’s alright just about</p>
<p>Frank: well, XXXX Park, Barking Park, was where…most of it was going to take place we didn’t have anything to do with other places…but our area was…XXXX…Barking Abbey, but firstly we had to support XXXX we had a pavilion of industry XXXX, Longbridge Road and then a road down to XXXX and erm…I think we had our swimming pool, open aired swimming pool, XXXX and XXXX</p>
<p>I think it opened about 1930, the swimming pool</p>
<p><em>Oh course yes</em></p>
<p>I was about fourteen I think</p>
<p>Frank: I was fifteen</p>
<p>You were fifteen</p>
<p>Frank: I had to be if she was fourteen</p>
<p>And when the XXXX, that arranged all the wonderful erm week, was a whole week, we had and I was in the pageant, they called it the pageant and Mr XXXX…</p>
<p>Frank: it was, XXXX was XXXX pageant master, XXXX was…pageant master</p>
<p>Yes I know he was the boss</p>
<p><em>Erm</em></p>
<p>He arranged it all</p>
<p><em>Sorry this was the charter day celebrations in 1931</em></p>
<p>Yes ‘30</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>When we were made a borough, erm I ‘m sure it was about ’30</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Cos I was thirteen…</p>
<p>Frank: it was ’31, it was ‘31</p>
<p>I’m glad, I’m sorry I didn’t take picture…all I had was a white blouse and a floral skirt to the floor and we were told…erm what to wear and I don’t remember if they gave the material or whether mum just had it by and made</p>
<p>Frank: yes something’s came from…</p>
<p>XXXX cap [Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: oh you…</p>
<p>And sometimes in these old plays they do they have them the same, they’re just white XXXX cap what they were called, with an elastic round [Laughs] so, oh…when I think all my family were in it, yes I would have been thirteen or fourteen yes at the time</p>
<p>Frank: well you can tell if its 1931 can’t you?</p>
<p>Well I’m not right am I then</p>
<p>Frank: your family are up and down all over the place</p>
<p>No I’m not</p>
<p>Frank: and size</p>
<p>I’m ninety-four now and here we are 2010…?</p>
<p><em>Eleven</em></p>
<p>Eleven, 2011 and I thought it was 1930 am I right?</p>
<p><em>It’s 1931, was the charter day</em></p>
<p>Frank: ’31, yes well actually, XXXX required a great deal of organisation and schools obviously took great part of it…preparation for instance, the largest motorboat on the lake was dressed up as a Viking ship</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>Frank: leaving sheets of thin wood…XXXX mast and a sail…appropriately designed and a Viking XXXX of some kind</p>
<p>There was a picture of the XXXX in the local paper</p>
<p>Frank: Mmh</p>

<p>You don’t have to go anywhere else, there’s everything there that you want</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX…or XXXX</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: and…it’s a rather dreary music and I XXXX and we got fed up with it anyway but erm…there was all this XXXX left over XXXX cos we provided most of our material, but we didn’t have to give it back…so that XXXX for when the XXXX and 2011 wants to XXXX</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: now what else, oh that…XXXX they had this XXXX stage of timber…an angle…about forty to forty-five degrees, and XXXX and this…and on the last evening, the Saturday evening, there was a grand face stuffing XXXX…cakes and drinks and things all free</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Frank: so that, that…of course XXXXX again was used for the production, for seating and doing things…erm unfortunately I was only in one scene, and I only saw glimpses of, of others</p>
<p>[Laughs] you came following our scene, the country scene I was in…</p>
<p>Frank: I know you were</p>
<p>And my dear mother and my two sisters and myself were in it…I think we only did it once a day though, they did do it afternoon and evenings didn’t they? I think</p>
<p>Frank: yeah, yes</p>
<p>Oh it was lovely, when I think back…</p>
<p>Frank: it was grand, yes; we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, especially XXXX at the end</p>
<p>When I first…went to the town hall…and it came into my being different things…and it said…19…that year would have been…or was it after I went back…the population in Barking at that time when I was at the town hall, it was fifty-nine thousand</p>
<p>Frank: it was about that for sometime</p>
<p>Fifty-nine, it didn’t change did it?</p>
<p>Frank: not much, but then XXXX the council houses, it filled up rapidly</p>
<p>Yes well when they closed all, or pulled down Upney hospital which I thought was very sad because so many people from Barking and East Ham, used to go there, now they’ve got to go to…Goodmayes Lane…no Barley Lane, Barley Lane, yes it’s a long way for people unless…oh Newham have a hospital now haven’t they, yes I think…my sister bless her…erm who married…you know the hope in Barking, is it still there?</p>
<p><em>The Hope…?</em></p>
<p>Gascoigne Road, the Hope pub.</p>
<p><em>I’m afraid I don’t know, I…</em></p>
<p>Gascoigne Road, I think it’s probably still there</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>My sister married the son from the Hope, Barking, in Gascoigne Road, it used to be, I don’t remember much about it, but I know where Gascoigne Road was it came out into the old Broadway, didn’t it, it the old days?</p>
<p>Frank: that’s one of old XXXX, name of course after of our Barking worthies</p>
<p>Barking…</p>
<p>Frank: Barking worthies or Gooding, many had money up the top [Laughs]</p>
<p>What was, what was Williams Warne’s, before William Warne’s brought, in Barking, the XXXX Company, William XXXX, William Warne’s, William Warne’s XXXX Company, my dad built that…erm…and it was built like small bungalows, all detached you know…and all one storey I mean…something like the…on the edge of the hospital, they have bungalows, different departments for there…they used to have it here as well</p>
<p>Frank: was that XXXX the population or just for profit?</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p>Frank: was that to relieve the pressure of population or just money?</p>
<p>No this was only at the hospital, I’m talking about</p>
<p>Frank: I don’t remember seeing that, I went into Warne’s once because</p>
<p>William Warne’s, yes</p>
<p>Frank: I might have…to work there, if they wanted me, but I didn’t get the job unfortunately …fate was waiting for me round the corner</p>
<p>Perhaps dad was working there then…he was too old</p>
<p>Frank: something…no I was wasn’t I was seventeen at the time</p>
<p>Well who had it before William Warne’s, do you know?</p>
<p>Frank: no I don’t know…I forgot, I didn’t have a car, I didn’t cycle then, I was lazy so I didn’t want to walk down there</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: all kind of things stopping me</p>
<p>Erm I’ve got a feeling, dad had told me, he came down with this firm, that owned William Warne’s, after the firm dad came down with from Scotland, William Warne took it over from this firm, that I can’t remember it’s name, so it’s going back a good few years [Laughs] but he used to do a lot of work at William Warne’s, like buildings…more buildings as they got more land…they’re just like bungalows, like they used to have over at Goodmayes hospital, single storey buildings, they had them at Upney as well, like little bungalows different departments, had their own little buildings</p>
<p>Frank: was it because of TB?</p>
<p>It could have been, it could have been...but erm…</p>
<p>Frank: and what the other thing that was right XXXX</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p>Frank: what was the other thing, that was XXXX at the time…most people seem to get it</p>
<p>No I think it was only TB wasn’t it? It was I think…only TB</p>
<p>Frank: they ended up with defective bones</p>
<p>Erm…Multiple Sclerosis</p>
<p>Frank: probably, yes I think so, yes</p>
<p>I’ve got Osteoporosis, my sister had…what did I just say… [Laughs]</p>

<p>Multiple Sclerosis, my sister had, and I’ve got Osteoporosis…and it’s only the last ten years, I was alright when we got married wasn’t I?...I was alright when I got married?</p>
<p>Frank: I don’t know</p>

<p>How many?</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Hundreds I would say… [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Did you see them quite a lot?</em></p>
<p>Erm…XXXX would have been the sergeant major, cos my husband had a band, and he used to play over there for the dances</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>And often at night, he’d bring this man back, what would he be called…over a group of men…not sergeant, sergeant something, anyway, he’d bring him back for drinks and I’d here them talking down here all night</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>

<p>Frank: and even out of it</p>
<p>Cos he lived here of course</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>

<p>They got a direct hit, down the bottom here, all the XXXX were killed, you know…this short road at the bottom here</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>Used to be called Levett, is it still Levett Gardens?</p>
<p><em>Erm, which, which one?</em></p>
<p>Levett Road, it goes across that way, level with this at the bottom of this road…</p>
<p><em>I don’t think I’ve been down there so I don’t know I’m afraid</em></p>
<p>And it’s different now; they’ve built a school on the ground</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>That was, that was the playing field, that area</p>
<p>Frank: that was Park modern</p>
<p>Huge playing field, my sister went there when it first opened…and she would have been erm…I suppose about eleven or twelve</p>
<p>Frank: mmh</p>
<p>When it first started, yes…and erm they had a huge playing field and I mean huge, the school was there on this Road, half way down this road, there’s a short road, that’s Levett Road, cos Levett Gardens, that was very mislead, Levett Gardens I used to get letters here, don’t know why</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>Levett’s down the bottom, and I had to go to Ilford, yeah I used to get them quite a lot…perhaps their name was Hewitt too, and that’s why, might have been…but Levett Gardens, and this was Levett Road, and it went to…</p>
<p>Frank: yes they always confuse…</p>
<p>Its level with Longbridge Road, went right up to the station up and then up to the station.</p>
<p><em>Could you actually physically describe what a barrage balloon looks like cos obviously a lot of people now, they would never have seen one</em></p>
<p>Frank: I only know one, one film of all those made during the war and after, which showed a shot of, of the barrage balloon, you sit on a corner down there, and look across over there…</p>
<p>Describe the colour, or the size and what shape was it</p>
<p>Frank: there were silver</p>
<p>Silver</p>
<p>Frank: Silver and they…were fabric I think…XXXX [Laughs] and they had…had a team for each balloon, and they’ll have a wench and steel drums, and they’d let them out cos they had…had cylinders, with gases in and they would let the gases in and… up shot the XXXX to several thousand feet if necessary, and there was a bit of a XXXX of low flying planes, I think it killed off, the XXXX they were XXXX jeans, built to dive vertically on a object and if you XXXX you just…you wouldn’t feel happy anyway, but erm I think they had so many…</p>
<p>Yes round here cos of the guns</p>
<p>Frank: it’s like a Christmas pudding XXXX [Laughs]</p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p>They were a funny shape you couldn’t say they were circular could you?</p>
<p>Frank: No they weren’t, they were oval</p>
<p>And they had the guns here and the girls down erm…there’s a new school they built down here, isn’t it? Well on that playing field, this, this…short road is at the bottom of this Hulse Avenue, and round…Levett goes there well that’s where my sister went to the first Park modern school, when it first opened, but of course it’s all new buildings there now, but it was facing Longbridge Road in that position and she was in the first lot, when it opened and Frank was in the second lot I think, the next year</p>
<p>Frank: she’s historical…</p>
<p>Well she’s not here is she bless her</p>
<p>Frank: sorry dear</p>
<p>My sister</p>
<p>Frank: sorry</p>

<p>Frank: yes</p>
<p>Strips</p>
<p>Frank: they were…they were called…I’m not sure whether they called by…bombs being dropped or the machine gun fire, but anyway one stormy night, really nasty and these…a team of about ten to twelve girls XXXX all attached to the XXXX centre of the field, just over there, in the centre of it</p>
<p><em>Is that in Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>Mmh</p>

<p>Frank:…whenever they XXXX, wasn’t quick enough, those girls were killed and just XXXX playing field, XXXX explode of…dropped was XXXX out</p>
<p>Those XXXX was all killed, they were guarding the…actually the guns here on the playing field, the girls weren’t they? They had the…what they called…</p>
<p>Frank: what?</p>
<p>The balloons, they had to stop the planes coming down low near the guns, and we have a thousand pound bomb opposite here in the concrete behind the garden, the walkway at the back, before the railings, there was a thousand bomb and we weren’t aloud to come up here, and I’d only just got married, six months and that happened, and I lived in the first house round the corner, and I…my dad had given me half a dozen chickens cos there were no eggs during the war, only foreign egg and he carried one under each arm [Laughs] because I was bombed out…and erm the police stopped us, ‘what are you doing with those chickens’, my dad said ‘it’s my daughter, she’s been bombed out’ and the chickens were alright, the bottom of the garden in the first house that side and it was wonderful that they survived and that they still laid eggs [Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>Road island reds, they’re the best XXXX for laying [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] that’s a lovely story</em></p>
<p>No when…</p>
<p>Frank: it’s true [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>When I went to Retford in Nottinghamshire, they didn’t know there was a war on, I mean I’d come from a badly Blitz area anyway and they didn’t know there was a war</p>
<p><em>Really</em></p>
<p>They really didn’t we’d walk into Retford shopping, this lady I was staying with, she was lovely, she had two boys and he was a captain in the…army, her husband, but I never did get round to meeting him, he never came home all the twelve or fourteen months I was away</p>
<p>Frank: [Laughs] a true officer</p>
<p>Mmh, he never came home or being a captain he couldn’t leave his men, could he? And my husband was in the navy…erm he hated the water, he could just about keep himself for float, he wasn’t a strong swimmer, although he was a big man, he didn’t like water, and he was in the sea and then…Atlantic Ocean for five hours, before the American came back to pick him up with the rest of the one who hadn’t died…XXXX on their crew there was three hundred and thirty something, I’ve always remembered that, and so many…luckily for him, he wasn’t an officer, but the officers quarter…where they all lived that end of the ship, whether it was XXXX or the back, I don’t know, and that sunk immediately, so all those lives were lost, the officers, he was kept, he was in the water, in the Atlantic, for five hours and I was expecting the baby, at that time, and they put these survivors…erm now who was it? A well known…Lord someone pulled him up the side of the ship, Lord someone, it wasn’t Lord Bath, I don’t think, but someone in that area, Lord, pulled him up the side of the rescue ship and he had terrible, terrible sores all down the fronts of his legs…cos they pulled him up, his probably lifeless being in the water for five hours…and he had those sores for weeks, before he got rid of them, but they saved his life from the sea, but he…always said, it was the thought of me expecting the baby, that’s right, and erm that would have been 19…43, yes 194-, we were married 1940, yes nearly… between ’42 and ’43 it would have been mmh…and erm it must have been terrible for him, his particular friend was lost in that accident and it was the Queen Mary, that cut their ship in two…believe it or now, that’s the truth, it never got in the paper, it never got in the paper</p>
<p>Frank: and then after it, everybody knew about it.</p>
<p>Well Frank knew about it</p>
<p>Frank: I knew about it</p>
<p>There was only one fellow I knew…that went…a friend of erm Edna Taylor, her husband, boyfriend they always went around together and he, he told me…he was down at Edna’s, down the road here one day and he was there cos he was Jack’s friend and he said he knew about…but erm…it happened I think it was October the 3<sup>rd</sup>, it was a terrible accident, Queen Mary cut their Cruiser in two, and it was the officer’s quarters they caught, they went too close, they were escorting all these cruisers, XXXX were escorting the Queen Mary, full of Americans…bringing the troops over</p>
<p>Frank: thousands of them</p>
<p>And they just cut…the cruiser in two…bigger than a destroyer I think, aren’t they? I think.</p>
<p>Frank: of course they are dear.</p>
<p>Yeah well I’ve never seen one</p>
<p>Frank: just XXXX</p>
<p>And just cut the quarters where the officers were, they weren’t on deck, they were down below…but Frank…erm Vic was so very lucky, he was kept in a church hall for three weeks, before he was aloud home…well in the Atlantic that time of the year, it might have been icy cold</p>
<p>Frank: terrible</p>
<p>And he said it was his life jacket that saved him, he couldn’t have…couldn’t have swam for five hours, no-one could and he saw friend who disappearing, how terrible, terrible and that was 19…about ’41…no could have been ’42 or ’43 that happened, but the…our Queen Mary was full of American troops and they got too close…wouldn’t have been just XXXX it was, the XXXX the cruiser, but it wouldn’t have been just one escort there would have been a team of them, wouldn’t there, escorting the Queen Mary, with the Americans.</p>
<p>Frank: they dare not stop, at time</p>
<p>I know they said they couldn’t stop, but by the time they came back, of course half of them had died, there were three hundred…on that cruiser, I remember the amount..and I think it might have been thirty something saved, that’s all, so I was very, very lucky…no must…they were terrible times...</p>
<p>Frank: there was a XXXX of guns attached to the swimming pool, over the park</p>
<p>Yes</p>

<p>This is Hulse Avenue…Doctor XXXX house is there dear, he was an Irish doctor, he was well known in Barking and he had been here for years, and she went back to Ireland with the children and I think soon after he followed…but he was a well known doctor, who’s that man out there?...oh it’s Monday, dustbin day [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I saw someone come in the gate [Laughs]…but erm, no 19…I had the baby that’s right, so it would have been about ’42 I expect when Peter was born, yes I had a baby, and a case and erm…went to London all on my own…erm I think I phoned Barking station to...to find out what time the trains and where I went from...I didn’t know anything [Laughs] it’s terrible</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX today</p>
<p>And I had to change somewhere with the baby and the case...erm...Retford, Nottinghamshire, they did not know there was a war on...when I came back the bombing was worse, mum said ‘whatever did you come for?’ I said I couldn’t stand being away from Barking, I missed you so much’</p>
<p>Frank: [Laughs]</p>
<p>And I did</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>We both clung to each other cried</p>
<p><em>Ah, it’s lovely; I remember that you...your dad built the bandstand in the park.</em></p>
<p>My dad built that yes</p>
<p><em>Could you tell what year he built it?</em></p>
<p>Well he built the Blake’s corner with the clocktower and all those shops with the lovely bay...I don’t know if they’re still there, they might be, they’ve got a long bay, haven’t they Frank, not like that</p>
<p>Frank: Mmh, shallow...</p>
<p>If it’s still there...shallow bays, not like that dear, not like that, long bays over the shops, they’re dad’s build and they were attached to Blake’s corner, there was about four that side and then there...were three or four the other side in Ripple Road, but that’s not there anymore, is it?</p>
<p><em>It’s a shame</em></p>
<p>So I expect they’ve pulled those down, I don’t know</p>
<p>Frank; Mmh</p>
<p>Shame</p>
<p><em>Must be, must be</em></p>
<p>They would have erm...built after he came back from Canada...erm there was no work in England for Brickees and builders, and he went to Canada for two year</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And he...we saw the snow and people on the telly, didn’t we in that program, and he said he loved Canada, but it wasn’t fair to take women and children there, it was so bitterly cold and that was Winnipeg, South Canada</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Yes he was away a long time</p>
<p><em>So what year would he have built the bandstand then, would that have been before you were born?</em></p>
<p>I would say two years after the war finished, I would think, when Barking council had saved up the money [Laughs]...I should think...</p>
<p><em>Did you go...?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know it might have been before the war, might in it? 1918</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Oh they used to keep it lovely and...you went upstairs...up steps to the inside where every Sunday night there was brass band from somewhere and all the population of Barking stood round the bandstand, listening t the lovely music, it was just a known thing, there wasn’t a cinema in those, when I was a child...[Laughs] used meet Vera and her mum and dad, my cousin...yes Mr Blake...erm was a well known man in Barking and my dad and his brother started the first Barking football team in Barking</p>
<p><em>Ah ok</em></p>
<p>They were both very keen and they came down from Dundee when they were children...and I said to dad one day...I said ‘oh I’ve, I’ve meet a very nice lady, that had gone to North Street school to meet Ed’s little girl, she lived on...Park Avenue straight at the bottom and this lady, I’d met and got talking to and she had three little girls at North Street school and erm...her name was Max something and she was lovely and I’d gone to meet Rita a few times as a little girl from North Street and I mean I didn’t know, he lived in the very house, one-twenty-eight, my dad said to me ‘what number does lady live, that you talk about Clem, with the three little girls?’ I said ‘one-twenty-eight, she told me’ he said ‘that’s where lived when we first came down from Dundee’ wasn’t that strange.</p>
<p><em>What a coincidence</em></p>
<p>That was strange wasn’t it? Ah I think he would like to have met her to tell her that, but it was only because it was an odd day...erm Ed asked me if I’d go and meet Rita, cos she was living at the bottom...there’s one house on its own, it’s...erm not old like the others that are joined together, it stands alone, erm it was built after the others and she lived on the ground floor and it was lovely, nice big rooms, it was different from the rest of the road, and erm, she only had the one baby and he was in the army, and they took the ground floor and it was lovely, it was erm...two nice size rooms and a kitchen and a bathroom, that’s all they needed...that would still be there, that’s the entrance...where the entrance is in the corner down to the lake, go down Park Avenue, I don’t know if you can get down there now, and it was...down there...no dad built those from Shirley to Lyndhurst...and the first four I think it was were...bombed and they all caught a light, didn’t they, Doctor XXXX big house on the corner that dad did...on the corner of Shirley, looking off down Longbridge Road, down the double fronted house on the left as you go down Shirley, dad built it for this Mr Doc...Doctor XXXX from Upton Park and he and his wife were there and they were both killed....direct hit and of course the next house caught a light and the only two left was where we lived on the corner and the one our neighbour who was Doctor McXXXX, McXXXX, his son McDonald, that’s it...McDonald, was made me say the other name Doctor McDonald, well known Scot doctor, very well known...erm retched mouse again, just seen it...they...someone set some traps in kitchen, there it is back again</p>
<p><em>Where is it?</em></p>
<p>It’s made a hole by the pipe over behind the settee where it goes down in the cellar and one there in the bay window, see the pipe that goes into the ground, he’s chewed all the carpet to get in the cellar....[Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: once XXXX floorboards XXXX</p>
<p>He’s chewed a lot of the carpet...well one must be pregnant it’s so big, and the other one is a baby, just where the pipe goes down, he’s chewed all the carpet</p>
<p><em>Oh no, it’s a shame</em></p>
<p>I think they must be coming from the park</p>
<p><em>It’s possible</em></p>
<p>Haven’t had mice for years have we</p>
<p>Frank: No</p>
<p>No we haven’t Frank</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And I think Jenny’s set two traps in the kitchen</p>
<p>Frank: she has</p>
<p>They probably dance round them</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Frank: there are two</p>
<p>But that was the big one</p>
<p>Frank: two XXXX</p>
<p>Oh I don’t like mice do you?</p>
<p><em>They’re ok</em></p>
<p>Well I said to</p>
<p><em>I’d rather not have them in my home, but [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I said to Frank, a mouse has nearly kept you company while you were a sleep, I was sitting just...saw something move...it was making a bee line for Frank [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But I couldn’t have killed him, he had the biggest eyes, he must have been a door mouse</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>I think that’s the name that came</p>
<p>Frank: door mouse’s are about that size</p>
<p>It was tiny, it was tiny and I said to you</p>
<p>Frank: that size XXXX</p>
<p>And then there was a big one, then a little one again, it was a lovely long tail and immediately I thought when I saw it, it had such big eyes, I immediately thought door mouse, but I can’t say it was , because I’ve never seen a door mouse</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Haven’t seen a mouse for a long time have we?</p>
<p>Frank: you have not but you have now</p>
<p>No...That door mouse, I couldn’t have killed him [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>He was pretty, he was pretty and he was tiny and he had these enormous eyes</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>Well with the park opposite they could get thorough the air brick, there’s an air brick facing the gate on that skirting outside</p>
<p>Frank: a friend of ours used to catch...mice in a trap, then walk over the park and release it</p>
<p>Ah</p>
<p>Cos she couldn’t kill it</p>
<p>Frank: couldn’t kill</p>
<p>That was the old type trap, it was a trap and it could move around...but when she told us, we couldn’t believe she was a lovely lady, not that’s there’s anymore</p>
<p>Frank: born again christen</p>
<p>Lovely lady</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>He was a lovely man wasn’t he?</p>
<p>Frank: he was a lovely man</p>
<p>I think she put up with a lot</p>
<p>Frank: you would want to live with him</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>No I think she was very patient, very patient lady, she was only here a fortnight wasn’t she</p>
<p>Frank; yes</p>
<p>Ah....lovely, lovely lady...I’m wondering if the daughters living in her house Frank...I wonder if the daughters or if they sold it</p>
<p>Frank: just saying two daughters, one was erm...one...several jobs together in Barking and the other one was working for the foreign office</p>
<p>She was a teacher when she here off the XXXX wasn’t she the other one</p>
<p>Frank: yes</p>
<p>The eldest one</p>
<p>Frank: when she</p>
<p>The other one was in Europe wasn’t she, working in Europe, you know who else, old XXXX used to go to Europe, to see someone didn’t he [Laughs]</p>
<p>Frank: he was</p>
<p>No it was a lovely...lovely old town....must have been much, much nicer when dad first came, if he was ten, makes a lot of difference doesn’t it? But Blake’s corner was lovely, I’m sure it was three floors...over the shop and then the big, big clocktower and when I came...I think everybody did, as soon as they came out the station they turned to see the time</p>

<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember his name</p>
<p>Jenny: no she can’t, she won’t remember, but...I remember that was where they used to have all the greenhouses wasn’t it?</p>
<p>That’s right behind the tennis courts, they had the greenhouse</p>
<p><em>Ah ok</em></p>
<p>And they were lovely long ones, weren’t they</p>
<p>Jenny: yeah</p>
<p>Frank: I used to go over there, when they...beginning to...</p>
<p>It’s the fountains Jen, look, just about XXXX there</p>
<p>Frank: I used to buy my Brick...XXXX ground up into granules, beautiful</p>
<p>Jenny: I know they’re lovely things...I used to spend my summers over there, I was...</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>Jenny: cos I’m sixty-one, so...I was...I was born here was I?</p>
<p>Does it say 1950?</p>
<p>This is 1950s, so...</p>
<p>That’s before then, wasn’t it you went</p>
<p>Jenny: no erm...cheek</p>
<p>I’m sorry</p>
<p>Jenny: [Laughs]</p>
<p>I’m sorry, I’m thinking of when we’ve been married twenty years [Laughs]</p>
<p>Jenny: no forget about that, I’ve...that’s 1950s so that was the summer when...just after I was born</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Jenny: So you didn’t take me over there then, yeah in the sixties from school, you used to do the school holidays</p>
<p>Yes I did take you with Vera; I did take you over there Vera, Scotty’s wife and their daughter Angela, yes</p>
<p>Jenny: so what memories...there’s, oh what about the bandstand...because when erm I talking...you know when I was talking to that gentleman, who used to go and listen to Dad’s band, he said he remembers going over to the bandstand when dad was playing there and they’d all be dancing round the bandstand</p>
<p><em>That’s lovely, yes it’s a shame it’s gone, isn’t it</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yes</p>
<p>They started dancing on the tennis courts, until they got permission to dance round the bandstand, but that slope used to be covered in geraniums going up to the bandstand erm...our friend said what year was the bandstand built, well I expect it was when dad came back from Canada</p>
<p>Jenny: oh it was built before the memorial was it? Was it built before he built the...war memorial? Do you think...if dad was playing there, that would have been before the war, so that was have been, the thirties...</p>
<p>The war memorial I should....</p>
<p>Jenny: When my dad was...would have been playing over the park, at the bandstand that was the thirties wasn’t it? Cos that was before the war...dad with his band</p>
<p>What year was it the pool opened ’30 was?</p>
<p><em>Circa 1930 or ’31 I believe</em></p>
<p>I was going to say 1930, it’s 1950 this picture, but it’s not a good one of the fountains because of the background, it’s a shame, those fountains were lovely and oh course you can’t see the beauty of it cos it’s in front of this building, that’s the entrance I think in, which is...just a little to the right, they’ve just painted it...painted it cream</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Mind you I don’t think it’d been painted for years</p>
<p><em>No [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Must have taken a lot of paint</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] oh yes, that’s South Park entrance...are they using that dear?</p>
<p><em>Erm...currently they’re using it as office space, so the park manager, erm his office is in there at the moment</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s good</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Frank: they’re not going to pull it down are they?</p>
<p>I think...</p>
<p><em>No, no</em></p>
<p>Frank: wouldn’t surprise me</p>
<p><em>They’ll keep the lodge</em></p>
<p>I think it’s lovely</p>
<p><em>It’s beautiful</em></p>
<p>Frank: the terrible is a night protecting it and vandalism</p>
<p>Let’s hope they’ve got a dog, hope they’ve got a dog</p>
<p>Frank: well XXXX when they get the council, decide to have their, their...games room and...the park, course their garden was always lovely</p>
<p>Frank: so it should be</p>
<p><em>What do you remember about the wildlife in the park? Do you remember lots of animals?</em></p>
<p>Squirrels more than anything</p>
<p><em>Squirrels</em></p>
<p>Used to be loads of squirrels down by the lake on the tall trees boarding the lake</p>
<p>Frank: yes and...</p>
<p>1948 yes, yes it could have been him, it’s a lovely building, its Frank?</p>
<p>It’s was old Dawson’s....erm study building</p>
<p>Jenny: so are you more interested in the wildlife side do you?</p>
<p><em>To be honest it’s just all memories</em></p>
<p>I think...</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>Jenny: if you...perhaps get them talking about the...the charter cos i...i know she remembers quite a lot about it....</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p><em>...the whole family was in the countryside scene and then obviously frank was like in the Saxon warriors, so it’s quite nice to have...its lovely</em></p>
<p>Frank: he designed....XXXX</p>
<p>Dawson’s</p>
<p><em>What’s that sorry?</em></p>
<p>The man that lived there was the head of the park, Mr Booton</p>
<p><em>Mr Booton</em></p>
<p>But the man that designed the house was a Mr...Dawson, you think</p>
<p>Frank: who?</p>
<p>Booton, Booton lived there, he was the head of the park</p>
<p>Frank: he did then, there’s a family of boys</p>
<p>Ah</p>
<p>Frank: a family of boys</p>
<p>Yes and one of the boys had one arm only, I don’t know...</p>
<p><em>Do you know what year that was that Mr. Booton lived there?</em></p>
<p>Oh...</p>
<p>Jenny: how old would...how old would you have been mum?</p>
<p>Sixty...more than sixty years ago isn’t it...in the forties I would have known wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><em>Cos I believe Les Taylor, who is that man in that picture, I think he lived there with his family as well...</em></p>
<p>Was his name Taylor?</p>
<p><em>Taylor, yes</em></p>
<p>But the first man I know lived there was a Mr Booton</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And he was head of the park</p>
<p>Jenny: so that would have been before ’48, wouldn’t it then?</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And it was his son...his son had one arm, I know it was a tragedy...it was a tragedy, he’d been brought at the boys...three boys had been brought a gun for Christmas and I just couldn’t....no-one could believe it, that was the story...and this, this boy had his arm shot off, he had a stump of an arm</p>
<p><em>Oh crikey</em></p>
<p>That was the story Mr Booton, I said it’s such a lovely building I would have loved gone over it, only a friend next door, Mrs Smith....who’s in the...started it off with the committee for this...Longbridge area...</p>
<p>Jenny: Norma Smith, that’s the one...</p>
<p>She said they were meeting there for their meetings that’s handy isn’t it?</p>
<p><em>The friends of Barking Park meeting?</em></p>
<p>Yes, friend of Barking Park</p>
<p><em>Ah yes, yes</em></p>

<p>What Jen?</p>
<p>Jenny: that big paddle steamer...</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Jenny: is that the picture of it?</p>
<p>Yeah, lovely</p>
<p>Frank: more XXXX in the old days</p>
<p>Jenny: would you hold onto the railing because you were afraid of falling?</p>
<p>I expect so [Laughs] 1931</p>
<p>Jenny: so you have to pad this out a bit, haven’t you?</p>
<p><em>Sorry?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: you’ll have to pad it out a bit</p>
<p><em>Oh it’s been, been great help for me because, it’s nice to hear people who actually saw it during the war because a lot of people...all the guns and everything</em></p>
<p>Oh I know...that it is...</p>
<p>Jenny: she’s mentioned all the</p>
<p><em>All the guns and everything, you were telling me that the house used to shake, when the guns went off?</em></p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p><em>You were telling me your house used to shake when the guns went off weren’t they?</em></p>
<p>That was Anna Neagle</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Anna Neagle</p>
<p>Frank: where</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<p><em>Yes I did</em></p>
<p>Just came to me</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Anna Neagle</p>
<p>Jenny: has it got the name down the bottom</p>
<p>No name no</p>
<p>Jenny: no</p>
<p><em>Do you remember seeing Anna Neagle, at the charter celebrations?</em></p>
<p>Well I was too busy entertaining with the country fair scene, no I hadn’t seen her but rumour soon went round...the rumours soon went round...it’s lovely to remember it by...XXXX</p>
<p>Frank: was there a water wheel or...</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p>Frank: was there a wheel somewhere dear, or was it on the back?</p>
<p>No perhaps that one came after this one, when was that 19...50</p>
<p>Frank: ‘51</p>
<p>Must have been before that one</p>
<p><em>Are you looking...that is a paddle one.</em></p>
<p>Oh it is</p>
<p><em>If you just let me see a second, I think</em></p>
<p>Frank:....looking for the paddle</p>
<p><em>Erm the paddle is right at the back, it’s not very clear</em></p>
<p>Oh that is it then yes</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Cos I went on it went it first started, the old XXXX [Laughs]...Mmh...</p>
<p>Frank: XXXX</p>
<p>What dear?</p>
<p>Frank: look like their got half a XXXX</p>
<p>That’s Longbridge road, that’s the green on the right...</p>
<p>Jenny: want a bit of battenburg</p>
<p>Aren’t these lovely to keep for the council</p>
<p>Jenny:...battenburg</p>
<p>Oh I’m fine thank you</p>
<p><em>The old boat house</em></p>
<p>Frank: thank you dear</p>
<p>That’s lovely...that’s a lovely picture isn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Yes I think that’s the Park Avenue entrance</em></p>
<p>No South Park</p>
<p><em>Oh is that South Park</em></p>
<p>That’s the South Park entrance</p>
<p><em>Ah ok</em></p>
<p>South Park entrance</p>
<p>Jenny: is there...</p>
<p>I’m sure...</p>
<p>Jenny; not like it is now...</p>
<p>This, this is the main entrance...that’s 1950s...</p>
<p>Jenny:...yeah but when you go in South Park now, you have that ride down...</p>
<p>Down to the paddling pool</p>
<p>Jenny: that’s not the paddling pool end is it? I think that the Loxford...</p>
<p>It used to be the paddling pool for the children</p>
<p>Jenny: yeah, no I don’t think it’s that end, I think it is Park Avenue look</p>
<p>Barking Park</p>
<p>Jenny; because that’s the wide...to get down to the paddling pool, you’ve got that</p>
<p>Oh yes, that’s the lake, yes</p>
<p>Jenny: narrow, yeah</p>
<p>That’s the lake and the island, so it would be from the triangle</p>
<p>Jenny: so is that the triangle or from where you used to live?</p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Jenny: cos mum used to live in Park Avenue, as Loxford...what is it? Loxford House</p>
<p>And we used to be on the swings, Ed and I every night after tea and mum say ‘be home by eight o’ clock’ we’d run all the way home</p>
<p>Jenny: back to the putting shed</p>
<p>[Laughs] yes those fountains, do you remember</p>
<p>Jenny: yeah I remember</p>
<p>They were lovely, but that doesn’t do it justice, they were beautiful</p>
<p>Jenny: I remember that</p>
<p>It you get that clearer, that would be lovely</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Jenny: and the diving board was here as well, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Could you talk about that, if you don’t mind, if you mind just sort of describing what a day out at the lido would have been like for you?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: for me or...well the turnstiles were still there weren’t they? Use to go through the turnstiles and you turn right and there’d be the restaurant and then you go into the changing rooms and then we’d always sit over the back...erm</p>
<p><em>Oh in the sunbathing area</em></p>
<p>Jenny: That bit there and sunbath, especially during the school holidays, you’ll all meet up on that bit and obviously go swimming but then the best bit was when you used to go back to the restaurant and there be...the wagonwheels, buy wagonwheel, which were huge, I think they seemed huge because we were little</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Jenny: they’ve definitely got smaller now, and erm Bovril, like they’d do hot Bovril, you know...just...bits and pieces and erm, you’d spend the whole day there, it was really lovely.</p>
<p><em>So did you use the slide and the diving boards as well?</em></p>
<p>Mind you tea dear?</p>
<p>Jenny: erm...not really...I’m a bit chicken</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Mind your tea, XXXX I didn’t want you knocking the glasses and tea over, mind your arm, keep it in the chair, your touching the cup and saucer nearly</p>
<p>Frank: right oh</p>
<p>Jenny: no it was lovely; it’s such a shame, that it’s closed I suppose it was the up keep of it, but erm...</p>
<p>Can I have my frame please Jen?</p>
<p>Jenny: but it seemed huge...</p>
<p>Sorry</p>
<p>Jenny: you know it seemed...</p>
<p>Frank:...Barking...not so old...1920...</p>
<p><em>1920</em></p>
<p>Frank: that would be</p>
<p><em>Ah, oh sorry [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I was born 1918</p>
<p>Jenny: you were born 1918</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Jenny: where were you born mum? In Loxford house?</p>
<p>In the house yes</p>
<p>Jenny: in Loxford house?</p>
<p>We had a midwife in those days, nobody went to hospital</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And poor mum had seven</p>
<p><em>Crikey</em></p>
<p>She lost the first baby</p>
<p>Jenny: did she? Oh I didn’t know that...see</p>
<p><em>You learn something as well</em></p>
<p>Jenny: do you live in Barking?</p>
<p><em>Erm I actually live in Walthamstow</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh right</p>
<p><em>So erm it not too far away</em></p>
<p>Jenny: no</p>
<p><em>Especially with the overground now</em></p>
<p>Jenny: I know that’s really handy, isn’t it, Gospel oak line</p>
<p><em>It’s only about twenty minutes, I think</em></p>
<p>Jenny: I know, we erm...used to go Walthamstow market</p>
<p><em>Oh did you?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: now and again, you know when you get that...but I haven’t used the line for ages and then...had to go to XXXX erm...out...like an out source clinic erm...Tottenham, Harrigay</p>
<p>Oh right ok</p>
<p>Jenny: so we, we got the erm...Harrigay lane</p>
<p>Harrigay green lane or something</p>
<p>Jenny: yeah Harrigay green lane, so...</p>
<p><em>It’s all of the above [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Jenny: it’s really nice efficient line now isn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it’s quite handy</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah, I was coming into the boathouse...I remember that’s the, that’s the...other entrance isn’t it there</p>
<p><em>Ok....so did you used to sort erm...meet your friends at the boathouse to go rowing or anything like that?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: no, no</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Jenny: used to go and play tennis</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>Jenny: especially after Wimbledon had been on, you’d always get loads of people</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Jenny: in the tennis courts and we’d go in the evening...because it was so convenient, cos...being here, and everybody probably came round here and then we’d go over there and erm...we’d go swimming and then you had the carnival in September so you...and that was brilliant because you’d just stay over the fair</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Jenny: sixpence and that with like XXXX, so that was...early ‘60s, probably I’m thinking of and erm...take a sixpence over with me and it’ll last the whole evening</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] wow, it is a bit different from now, isn’t it</em></p>
<p>Jenny; I know, I know, that hasn’t been...is that still there, the boathouse</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, I think not because they’re doing a redevelopment in that whole area</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah we’ve been over there recently...perhaps I didn’t notice, the thing is you walk round sometimes, and you don’t notice</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Jenny: we did erm...park in the new car park down...</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Jenny: you know when you go down South Park Drive and just walked all round but you couldn’t get...although the lake is filling up, you couldn’t get close</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Jenny: close to it...</p>
<p><em>I mean, I think they’ve actually finished filling it now</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh</p>
<p><em>They’re just finishing sort of the building works and...Cafe</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah, so they’re making little erm...I don’t know if it’s...plants there, like little...little island, but not islands but coming out so it’s not the shape it was, it’s...you got like...platoons, that type of thing isn’t it</p>
<p><em>They’re going to have a floating dock I think</em></p>
<p>Jenny: ah</p>
<p><em>So that sounds quite exciting</em></p>
<p>Jenny: no it’s lovely...and it’s always been such a...nice..park, never really much trouble there is there</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>Jenny: well perhaps they did have some...</p>
<p><em>I think it won sort of safest park or something in London last year or something</em></p>
<p>Jenny: did it?</p>
<p><em>But they worked really, really hard, so I believe there was a period, there was starting to get a little bit of trouble in the park, but they really sort of clamped down on it straight way</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah</p>
<p><em>And now it’s erm...</em></p>
<p>Jenny: no and erm...whenever I go back over there, it just feel...like you’re going back to when you was a teenager because, you know walking by the side of the lake and walking round the garden part, that’s just some change, like the feeling XXXX changed it’s lovely...and the beautiful trees...oh yeah they’ve got some, definitely got some good photos of the erm...charter</p>
<p><em>Oh thank you</em></p>
<p>Jenny: with the...all of them dressed up...anti-aircraft gun...what’s that, is it the First World War?</p>
<p><em>Yes that’s the end of the First World War, that picture was taken</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh right</p>
<p><em>I couldn’t find any pictures at all of the guns during the second and I don’t know whether that’s because, they’re classified [Laughs] or what, but I was hoping someone might have some you know sneaky that they took themselves</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah</p>
<p><em>But unfortunately not, which is a real shame, cos it’s almost like a period, that you know a history black spot in the, the history of it, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yeah, I reckon that erm...Ron, I know he lives in Salisbury Avenue...he would probably have some good memories, I think he’s...coming up for ninety, so just a little bit younger, but</p>
<p><em>Well if you do speak to anyone, please pass on my details to them</em></p>
<p>Jenny: yes...have you got your phone number?</p>
<p><em>Yes I’ve got a leaflet here, so I’ll give you one of those</em></p>
<p>Jenny: I remember the paper coming through the door...erm for mum</p>
<p><em>I’ve written my name on that, that’s one of our leaflets</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh lovely</p>
<p><em>And I think I left you a leaflet last time, didn’t I? I gave you a leaflet last time?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh so this isn’t your first time Claire?</p>
<p><em>Sorry?</em></p>
<p>Jenny: you’ve been round....</p>
<p><em>Oh I came round before, but I think had our wires crossed a little bit, and I didn’t want to do an interview and have to sort of XXXX on the</em></p>
<p>Jenny: cos mum said ‘oh lady from the...council came round’</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>Jenny: erm I think...I thought Westminster home care, I thought like the social services</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>Jenny: so I don’t know whether they thought you were...</p>
<p><em>No I was from somewhere else [Laughs] woops [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Jenny: and where’s all the details kept...at the...oh right, Ilford Methodist Church basement.</p>
<p><em>Well that’s where our office is based, but we’ve been commissioned to do the oral history project by Barking Park, so technically we’re working with the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham</em></p>
<p>Jenny: Right</p>
<p><em>And the Heritage Lottery Fund, who are funding the project</em></p>
<p>Jenny: is that thorough the national lottery?</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes the Heritage Lottery...Fund erm they’re...and then hopefully, eventually all the oral histories will go into the Valance House Museum and archives there, so...</em></p>
<p>Jenny: oh nice</p>
<p><em>...everyone can sort of access it and hear people memories and be lovely, it should be really, really nice...oh thank you</em></p>
<p>Jenny: let me just erm...</p>
<p>Frank: Barking Abbey School</p>
<p><em>Barking Abbey yeah</em></p>
<p>Frank: had two skiffs, on the lake</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>Frank: and I think, I can’t be too sure, there were four rowers and a Cox...</p>
<p><em>So they actually owned two skiffs themselves~?</em></p>
<p>Frank:....I was thinking that, did they actually own it or do they just hire</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Frank: but erm...they obviously need maintenance...and one year they just weren’t there anymore [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s...</em></p>
<p>Frank: four...and a Cox and we used to rush off, after school to see which team could get to the...skiff before the other because there was gradual...damage to them and erm, you wanted to get there before the other team was because...once you got started at one end of the lake or the other it wasn’t, and you got to the islands, there wasn’t enough room for two to row...side by side...on one side of the lake or the other, so it was great advantage to get there first, the other team couldn’t pass you...but the XXXX, I don’t think the staff or many of the pupils, had any interest at....you didn’t see...several teams or groups lined up at five o’clock...but we liked it, that why we kept...</p>
<p>Jenny: still looking</p>
<p>Frank: well that’s all....I’m sure Jenny will find stuff for you</p>
<p><em>I’ll just stop the tape now actually, cos I think it’s about to run out, I’ve forgotten how long I’ve been here, I’ve been here two hours, can you believe [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Jenny: do sure you don’t want a drink</p>
<p><em>Oh I’m fin-</em></p>
