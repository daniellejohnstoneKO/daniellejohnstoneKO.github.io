And he was born with a beautiful voice and err, he sang ever-, he went all round, he sang in the cathedrals and in Canterbury cathedral up in Westminster, he, he was one of these young boys that had a wonderful voice you know. And my Granddad, my granddad used to take him boxing and my mother nearly died when he cae-[laughs] he came home and all his face was messed up and the following day he was singing in the cathedral.</p>
<p><em>Crikey, how did he look?</em></p>

<p><em>Was it, was it…</em></p>
<p>I don’t know if I were her to shoutin’ and my brother lookin’ very sorry for hisself</p>
<p><em>Bless him, he must have been quite embarrassed himself.</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] Yeah I know, I know but err, my mum, my, my Grandfather he was erm, he was eld-, he worked for Ba-, erm the, er gas work, the gas company, Barking, you know the gas company that was here and erm, he lived, I know you going to laugh about this but his fa-, all his erm, family, all had pubs and they had the ferndow(?) Pub in erm Cyprus and d’you know where Cyprus is?</p>
<p><em>I do know where Cyprus is yeah..</em></p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p><em>Erm, well it’s kind of in the Meditterraenean isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>No, no. no, not Cyp-, no at Woolwich [laughs] That’s where Cyprus is. Did you know that Cyprus at Woolwich.</p>
<p><em>No, no I thought Cyprus was just the Island off of Greece</em></p>
<p>No, no and his father use to ran-, run the, erm, er you know, he use to er, er, have the Ferndow Public House in Cyprus. Um, that is down sort of on the Woolwich you know when you’re going down to the ferry sort of thing and erm, err, he er, huh, he, he boxed, my Granddad boxed you see and he boxed erm, ooh I can’t remember, Alfred tell you, the, er pedlar, something Pedlar, something, somebody or the other, he was a champion boxer and he said to my granddad that erm, he would give him three rounds ‘cause my Granddad thought he was cat’s whiskers you know and he’d ,he’d take him for three rounds and if he beat Pedlar he was the champion. The, er, he would give him a Guinea, my granddad did, he knocked him out [laughs]</p>
<p><em>How many rounds did it take?</em></p>
<p>Three, it was only three rounds [laughs] Alf! What was the name of the champion that granddad ….</p>
<p>Alfred Groves: Pedlar Palmer</p>
<p>Pedlar Palmer, see I’m taking you way, way back here, in older, old Barking you see.</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s great. We like that as far back as you can go is fine by me.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that’s what I mean, that takes you way, way back.</p>
<p>Alfred Groves: xxxx him at Wanstead Flats.</p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>Alfred Groves: He fought him at the fairground at Wanstead Flats.</p>
<p><em>Oh really?</em></p>
<p>Alfred Groves: And if you went three rounds you got, I that, either, I think it’s either ten shillings or a guinea.</p>
<p>No he got a guinea</p>
<p>Alfred: And he went the three rounds and got the guinea.</p>
<p><em>Wow. That’s a pretty impressive.</em></p>
<p>Though mean he bee-, erm, he’d been to the pub though hadn’t he, He’d been to the Ferndow, they were gonna have the er, have it in the Ferndow. I thought he’d did it at the Ferndow but…</p>
<p>Alfred Groves: Oh no it was on the Flats</p>
<p>I, I don’t know which way it was round but you-, you know the stories go round and round, and so of course my granddad wanted his grandson to be, none of his own sons were interested in boxing. But my brother, you know, he, my, when from the time he was his age, ‘cause granddad was older and had more time at home and err, he started tauch-, teaching him to box from when he f-first walk [laughs]</p>
<p><em>I think he probably regretted that later on</em></p>
<p>I er [laughs] yeah. I don’t know, I thought it seemed to get him out quite a bit of trouble with school and all that. But no, it, it erm, it, it, granddad had a great xxxx, I’ll tell you another thing he was, he worked in the, where was it he worked in, in Gat-</p>
<p>Alfred groves: In the retort house.</p>
<p>In the retort house</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>And the fo-, there was four men from the retort house that started up the Woolwich equitable.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know so old granddad was quite err…</p>
<p><em>You’re quite well connected aren’t you?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, my Grandmother, his wife erm, who it, actually granddad was his, her second marriage. Er, her father was the vicar of chel-, of erm, oh God what church was it Alf? I do let my brain go!</p>
<p>Alfred Groves: Chigwell</p>
<p>Chigwell church</p>
<p><em>Oh ok, where, where abouts is that? </em></p>
<p>Chigwell church</p>
<p><em>Oh Chigwell, sorry yeah.</em></p>
<p>D’you know on the, d’you know the corner, on the corner there the big church and he did a lot of the carvings, the, he was brilliant at, at wood carvings, but he was a evil devil to her. To his family.</p>
<p><em>Oh dear.</em></p>
<p>My Grandmother had to, she was very clever, she, she tried, you know, she got brilliant brains she and er she, he had her scrubbing all the, the things which he come out from teaching, she had terrible xxxx, some of these they did didn’t they so they’s… But any way, is err, you know it’s a, in fact my cousin it, at this moment is, is putting out, but that’s why all this is in my mind. ‘cause I’ve been bri-, we’ve been remembering it, bringing it all up for, for her. But then when Nan and Granddad came here to Barking, he came in to Morley Road, and um, they started up the Labour Party.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>The original crowd. My mum and Dad all, all were tied up and they finished, started up the Labour party, with other people. There weren’t the, once upon a time, I know there was erm, Julie Ingwell, all those people you know that started, the really bi-, they’re the people that built Barking. You know, they, they built, they, everything was done you know. Nothing was done for nothing. Everybody worked on it hard. And then my Dad, he, he designed and erm, there used to be a side of the level crossings. There used to be the labour hall there. And my father sought of designed it and built it.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>That was the side of the level crossings there and I don’t know what happened to it, it’s all been pulled down now hasn’t it? Where do you think it’s gone...</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I can’t remember it being there now.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, ooh I taught dancing in there for quite some, or how</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Yes you know and, and I started teaching but we got in fact it was the hall we had our wedding in you know.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Bein’ my father built it, but no it’s um, it’s, it’s all the old people of Barking that I know, you know. There’s so many of ‘em, and try-, you can see them but names have vanished you know, but it, it was such. Barking was always known, either Tories, the old Tories the xxx, liked Barking because Barking did everything for the people. Barking was a, a, a town you know that erm, was so proud of it’s borough and it, it was a, I can remember it more as a village and everything you know. As, as, every, everybody was always working something, never, it was never you know today, if you, if somebody does something, is how much err, err at what's your charge. That didn’t happen you see and that’s why people can’t understand me, at Faircross Community Association. There are, I mean we’ve worked since it opened in the 19, 19, at 1990s you know and we don’t want that see and you know lately they’ve all been forcing off to take a couple of hundred pound a year for his petrol ‘cause he’s, he’s running here there everywhere, yet n’everything, but the, todays people don’t understand. They think we’ve got screws loose because we do things for nothing. I mean for years here in Barking I’ve put on shows and the monies all gone to Barking to, to the erm, charities commission. You know we had a carnival charities commission, well that hap-, now that is where it ties up with the park. You see, because erm, we used to organise, we always had a float in the carnival and we won so many times, people use to hate us. [laughing] where there was the children</p>
<p><em>I’m not surprised I’ve seen your green xxxxx</em></p>
<p>Oh I mean all the children, no all the children loved er, loved er, when you’re in dancing loved dressing up don’t they? And so you know, you’d already got all your costumes, you didn’t have to pay up for costumes or anything. But now-, and then my girls carried on after me, you know they’d opened dancing schools, and they carried on afterwards but it, it, and so I say really and truly for me in Barking it, it’s, it’s all up, going up the ladder.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah I, I’ll go now sitting at the top of the ladder and you know, can’t do much. [laughing] Would the foot come down it. [Laugh]but erm, no its a, you see the park was used for the, for that even years you know and there was so many lovely things that went on and then when the erm, er, this came in they’d have lovely music there.</p>
<p><em>Ahh the band stand. </em></p>
<p>Yes, and that, pete-, it was wonderful music that you used to go and listen to on a Sunday. And it, and there you know then, you had the erm, little children paddling pool, and the big swimming pool. And that’s all been taken away. And in those days the erm, the people that use to walk round the park, they, they used to have gaiters, you know up here and they all walked round and all wer-, and they had a hat you know and they were always special that if you were a child playing in the park, those men were always there to help you, you know? And erm, you didn’t get all, never, to ask all this trouble that fighting and what have you in the park. You’d go there, you know and everybody would join in. It was much more joining in than arguing and what have you. You know, you might get somebody and, I mean the Irish, you had a lot of Irish that came to Barking and they said Oooh you don’t go with them, you don’t mix with them, but we can’t, you know if you got somebody that pushes them in and they find out their nice people but the only trouble was you see, they were so poor, where like my brother all his mates would take a bit and go over where the rough edge is and they’d build a, put a fire, and, and, cook their sausages. Load of smoke they were. Ooh but they did taste lovely [laughing]. And you see, you know the-, if, if some-, what they use to do, my cousin Jackie and my cousin br-, my brother, they use to pinch all my Grandad’s and Mum’s and th-. Their beer bottles and take them back and get like the err-, the whites bottles and all the- take them back and get the tuppence off of them</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You see and with that money, they buy sausages, if you get so chi-, sausage-, and then pinch a bit of Mum’s lard, and then they’d have this old, old bit of tin at the top and cook their sausages on [laughing]. They were gorgeous..</p>
<p><em>It’s a proper old fashioned barberque isn’t it...</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, you see and the point of it is that, and the-, as I say, sometimes the Irish p-, because they weren’t terribly clean you see and they’d got so many children, they didn’t know and what I used to do, it sounds dreadful, but we had Irish next door but one and I hate-, my mother was very fussy you know, we always had to be clean and what, and I used to take the children in and wash them and put them in my clothes that’s in the back [laughing] and my mum used to say to Rene who was next door, ooh I’m sorry. She said don’t worry, she doing me a good turn [laughing]. She said xxxx[laughing] I used to bring them in the washer bowl. Dictatorial I was from the age of six.</p>
<p><em>Is that how old you were when you used to do that? You were six?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, xxxx, I could-n’s, I couldn’t stand seeing a little baby run around with a dirty nose, so I had to, I had to wipe it, and take it in and wash it you see, ‘cause then we lived in Denway...</p>
<p><em>Denway....</em></p>
<p>You know Denham Way? On the Eastbury estate.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, number 19 Denham Way we lived. Yeah...</p>
<p><em>And what-, what schools did you go to in the area? Can you remember?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I went to, Eastbury..</p>
<p><em>Eastbury.</em></p>
<p>Then to Ripple, then passed a scholarship for Southit-, for when I was 11 for erm, Barking Abbey..</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Went there three months, and they all evacuated to [laughing] wherever I’m, you, you don’t wanna hear about the schools I went to, it’s unbelievable [starts laughing]</p>
<p><em>You went to quite a few xxx did you?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, because they kept-, yes well you see I went to there and then where did I go to after there?</p>
<p><em>Where were you evacuated to?</em></p>
<p>I weren’t evacuated.</p>
<p><em>Ahhh, right.</em></p>
<p>My dad was going to send us to, he used his younger bro-, brother over in, in Florida and my mum and dad was sendi-, gonna send my brother and I to Florida, to get out of the war. And then, that, the boat was sank with all the children on it, you know thousands, children got killed, got drowned. The erm, they, it was one, one of the first boats for the children to go to America, and they erm, the submarines you know...</p>
<p><em>That’s terrible.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and erm, so we didn’t go, but my gran-, my aunt-, my auntie, she, her husband was a big builder, and you know, he owned lots of property, that he used to live in Chadwell Heath. He bought a big house, a big-, a house with big moat, it was a house, sort of, say that’s the house there and all round it was a big moat.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>And it used to have a, a cottage at the side here, well our Nan, when sh-, when da-, Grandad retired they went and lived in that cottage, my auntie lived here, well when the war happened, we all went down and first of all, we, we-s-s, you know us children all slept together in the house and then my granddad bought, er my uncle brought, bou- sort of erm, these temporary hou-, you know, bedrooms and, so we were all on, on all the family, were there at moat house erm, during the war and my granddad used to, all the back there, was all veges and all animals [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and...</p>
<p><em>It sounds like quite an idealistic sort of setting really....</em></p>
<p>And then we lived in the Longbridge Road, my Mum lived in the Long-, Mum and Dad, moved to Longbridge Road. Xxxx Longbridge Road, opposite the park, and erm, while we were there erm, the Ack, Ack, had an Ack, Ack er thing opposite the par-, in the park. You know, did you know we had the Ack, Ack guns in the park.</p>
<p><em>I have heard about that. But could you tell me a little bit about that if that’s ok?</em></p>
<p>Yes, well the erm, guns were there and so were the erm, there was all tense in there, I can, you know, I can see them, all green tents, all in the, you know in that part of the park. And I tell you what, I was going to school one night ‘cause erm, we were staying at my granddads house in St Paul’s Road. This was after out house was er, no our house, our house was in the Longbridge road, my Dad was away, he was building erm, all the, these erm, wood planes, there were, what my granddad did, he helped on the, he was building the aero-, you know the what’s the names, for the Americans to come over.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>The big erm, what they called ‘em, air force things, you know the big things. And erm, what they did also, where out bombers were going out, ‘cause they were bombing the every air field. Erm, he ma-, they made a load of wooden aeroplanes. And the-, in these pla-, on these err air fields they’d dug right underneath and the planes went underneath, but so here there was bombing ‘em at the top, but they were only wooden ones</p>
<p><em>[laughing] So they were kind of like decoy planes.</em></p>
<p>Decoy planes</p>
<p><em>Right ok</em></p>
<p>Didn’t ye-, haven’t you heard about them?</p>
<p><em>Erm, I, I don’t know, I think I may have heard about it once but, you know, to hear someone who actually </em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>....made the decoy that’s amazing</em></p>
<p>Yeah, my, my f-f-father it, that’s what Dad was all, all tied up with all that you see, and erm... So of course he, he, they did it round here at, err, quite a bit but you see the point of it is, they hadn’t had the time, here at Hornchurch, ‘cause you know we had airfield at Hornchurch. They didn’t have the time to, that-, that, there is a big, a big bunker underneath but wasn’t big enough to, wasn’t, didn’t have time enough to do it for the-, you know, to put the planes under there, ‘cause the, the wings came, went up or something, and they, they went through. I didn’t actually see them but you know, xxxx listening to my dad tell us all about it. But then, we was in Granddad’s house ‘cause our house erm, had been, er, you know erm, burnt with the, all the erm xxxx, Barking was badly hi-, hit you know during the war. Badly hit during the war. And erm….</p>
<p><em>Do you know why Barking was such a big target during the war?</em></p>
<p>Well because we’ve got the gas works, we got a lot of works here haven’t we, Ford’s, lots of thing-, lots of, I mean all this area was quite-, anywhere along the river, I mean when we lived in errr, Denham way, at the end of the ro-, at the end of the road in Blake avenue, there’s St Patrick’s Church there, when I wa-, there was no St Patrick’s Church there, that was just the big field. And erm, that is where also all the, us kids used to play you see. And they had a big erm, they had the airforce there, with the Barrage Balloon at the end of Denham Way, they had all the unit there and the, Barrage Balloon went up in the air. Well [laughing] we lived number 19 Denham Way and err, one of ‘em, came down and they fired at the, fired at the erm, the Balu-, Barrage Balloon, and ‘cause it came down right over the top of our dug out [laughing] and the men come round in all the, air force men come round here, “Don’t smile, don’t do this, don’t do that, you’re perfectly alright!” you know [laughing] they ‘cause it’s all filled with gas wasn’t it. And…</p>
<p><em>Were quite afraid or?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know I…., it’s a weird thing to say, although it was horrible, it was frightening, for most marvellous time of their life.</p>
<p><em>Really.</em></p>
<p>Because everybody was with everybody, d’you know what I mean it, you went in a train, I mean how often do you sit on a train and don’t speak a word from the moment you get on to-, it doesn’t matter here, you got on the bus, everybody was talking to one another. You got on the train, everybody was talking to one another. I mean, you know, when I moved to Hockley, by the time I got down here, I knew all their life [laughing] and they’d all mine you know. An that’s the sort of thing it, it was. And that’s what I was saying. That was how this area was. Very close. Very friendly. And today’s it’s all gone. There’s no, no commu-, community as such, is it today, it’s too individual. Now it’s too individual. People don’t work together, they [pause], do they, I mean, it’s your life now. I-, it, it’s, if only you, I, I always say, used to say to my pupils, you know as I got on in years, I wish I could take you back to old Barking. You know, because if you got a child dancing and the mum couldn’t afford, you know, she’d got two or three kids there and couldn’t afford to pay the dresses, a lot of the people that did have money were put towards those kids dresses. You know what I mean, and that was the sort of thing that I, I sort of lived in and very difficult to find to-, today, people would walk past them wouldn’t they, they wouldn’t do it. That, that is I think the killing of, of the borough. It, it’s not, not what I know this borough. Not at all now. Hate it. But I wouldn’t move.</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s quite sad.</em></p>
<p>We, we was going to move, we going to move to Paynton, we got a bungalow there and erm, I was taken ill, I had erm, haematomas all over me and erm, had to go to the hospital and I got this rare blood disease [phone rings] he’ll answer it up stairs, anti biotic poison and erm, I, I was lucky in hospital you know and err, it-t-t-t, I, I just can’t believe all what’s gone on, you know? An-it, I went there and there was all my girls there to come to see me. If I’d been in, in Paynton, where we were moving to, I wouldn’t have seen a soul, only the people I knew down there, but I xxxx, whereas here while I was in hospital you know, it was a nightmare keeping the people out.[Laughing] Because, it’s all my, my dancing girls you see. Ok they don’t live here now they’re all over the place all in Essex, hardly, many o-, not many of them live actually in the Borough. But erm, every year, if you come here on the twenty-first of December there will be a table from here right down to the end there, and that is where all the girls that I trained and they’ve all become teachers and examiners, they all come and we have a big Christmas dinner</p>
<p><em>Oh lovely. </em></p>
<p>You know, and then, then added to that, another lot either, another night I have another lot of them. That were younger, in a younger lot of things [laughing] you know. And it, it’s, it’s just, that is, that’s why I didn’t wanna to mo-, well, move, because I said when I come out of hospital, I said to Alf, I we’ve been Paynton, I wouldn’t of had all these girls because they pull you through things. You know.</p>
<p><em>Like an extended family almost.</em></p>
<p>Yes, it’s jus-, it, it did, we’re like a big family. That is, that’s what I’m saying, Barking was err, a big family. You didn’t have, I mean you did have arguments between, as I say sometimes, the Irish people, used to upset. But once they got in, and got part of it, it was only the fact that there was so many children in xxx, most erm, sort of decent people had three to four childr-, or two to four children, but the Irish used to have eight to ten! And can you imagine what they look like, I mean, and nine times out of ten, the husband, spent most of his money i-, in the Harrow, you know [laughing] when he come home from work, and the poor women didn’t have anything you know to manage on. That I think once you got to know them and realised their you know the sort of lives they live, the kids got used to it because I mean you get somebody that’s got no decent clothes and they’re out with everybody that’s got everything. It’s like today, kids have got these telephones and some kids haven’t. And that’s why they’re pinching them aren’t they?</p>
<p><em>Yeh I suppose</em></p>
<p>See there’s no e-, sort of equality is there? In life. So erm, no, that it, you know if you were writing about Barking, but old Barking was really a lovely town. It really was, it was erm, if you had a down day. You’d go in to Barking, and you knew, you’d come back feeling totally different because you meet all people there you knew. You know I mean, no doubt you, I don’t know if you come from this area but if you went to school, you-, all your mates and all that you met everybody at school didn’t you and, “Oh hello, how you doing?” you know, then you’d go and sit and have a cuppa coffee and you, you walk away or tea and you know and you come away, how often do you see people doing that today?</p>
<p><em>Pf- its probably quite rare, I mean I’m, I’m not actually from London at all so I don’t-..</em></p>
<p>Where do you come from?</p>
<p><em>Erm, I’m from the West Country, I’m from sort of Bath, Bristol sort of way-</em></p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p><em>Bath, Bristol, yeah</em></p>
<p>Bath yeah, I’m a, I examine all over there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah?</em></p>
<p>I’ve been to Bath, Bristol, I’ve been you name it, I’ve been there [laughing]. And I spent long time down in, I mean I love Paynton, I’ve got some very close friends there, you know, that I made over the years, and erm, bein’ as my legs were going, and everything was going, we thought that we would erm, you know, get erm, bit of the stairs.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>But erm, I’m glad I, I didn’t live in a bungalow because, although it’s agony for me getting up and down the stairs, it’s the only bit of exercise that I get.</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>You see when you get like that, if you got nothing to push you, you don’t do anything do you?</p>
<p><em>Yeah I suppose it would be quite easy to become quite complacent.</em></p>
<p>I-,i-,i-, it does, I mean, i-, if I got up now, my whole toe over there would be quite agony, that I try not t-, to do everything all at once [laughing] you have to plan it all, but erm, no it’s erm, we’re not talking much about the park are we?</p>
<p><em>Sorry</em></p>
<p>But you know, no that is, you know, that is the situation and that happened in the park everywhere. You see you had the footballers, you had the tennis, the cricket, the you had the weekend footballers, you had the cricket playing. And in there, there was a great big erm, thing that you could play erm, was it where you have the red and white things?</p>
<p><em>Oh erm, checkers?</em></p>
<p>Checkers</p>
<p><em>Drafts</em></p>
<p>Drafts that’s it! There was a big one and you had a big thing and you used to move it around. That was over near the paddling pool. Then you’d got the tennis courts that always, were always fully in use. And everybody erm, using them. Er hat else did you have? You had such a lot going on in the park. And erm, you know i-, for school d-, outing you’d go in to the park and then you’d study all the trees and everything that was growing there. And then erm, i-, it is all things like that you’d take the stuff out, you know when gets all green in the, when they had the, they had a big erm, boat that used to go round you know, it was like the old fashion, you know, American thing, you know, that used to go..</p>
<p><em>I’ve got a photo of that actually.</em></p>
<p>You’ve got a photo have you?</p>
<p><em>You’ve got to see it</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Umm [unfolding of paper]Oh..i’ve been carrying these photos around with me, so it’s quite, it’s quite nice for…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, but, I, if I can find, I mean Alf said he get up in to the thing but we’ve had so, he’s had so much trouble with the bowls club at the moment.</p>
<p><em>Oh crikey, I don’t know where it’s gone. </em></p>
<p>What photos are they from? Can I have a look?</p>
<p><em>I, I’ll show, show you those ones anyway.</em></p>
<p>Oh the lido, that was lovely, that was our life, oh there it is yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever go on the, the paddle steamer?</em></p>
<p>Oh always yes!</p>
<p><em>Could you tell me about a time that you remember as a child going on the paddle steamer?</em></p>
<p>Yes! Tuppence.</p>
<p><em>It was that cheap was it?</em></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><em>And when, when, when was the very first time you went on that?</em></p>
<p>When it first st-, Ohh when it started. I, I can’t remember, eh, at Barking Park 1950, hu-, that was just after the war they did that. Then I think it did started cheap and then the children when on for tuppence so-, and then they think they started charging a shilling. Oh and they decorated it up for all different things. [Twang of laminated paper].</p>
<p><em>What kind of things were they decorate it for?</em></p>
<p>Well, if, it be special, like there, look it’s Hong Kong Odeon and you know all different erm, activities that were going on, they would dress up the ferry for it. And then they erm, they got a, a suit of an old erm, Grammer phone on there and they were playing all things you know, down the mississipi and all that.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah it was lovely, and ‘cause you had a nice erm, there was a nice errr, the boat, boat thing. A boat erm….[pause] what they call it? Is this the pie, yes, this is part of the front part was it. You can’t see the boat, boating lake, I mean ov-, over there , you know where you come in the front here…</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>…down the bottom there was big boating, where they use to keep all the boats down there.</p>
<p><em>Oh the boat house?</em></p>
<p>Boat house, beautiful place</p>
<p><em>Right ok.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>So did you go boating on the lake quite a lot? Did you take out one of the rowing boats?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes!</p>
<p><em>Or anything?</em></p>
<p>As kids, you’d have the ones that go round, you see this end? Look! This end of the, kmt, oh god, this end of the park, where’s the water, there’s the water here isn’t it. Where at that end where the park was that was the children’s one. And you use to have the, you go in there and you peddle it, peddle all round and not bash in to one another.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>Ohhh wonderful time. You know the, what they call ‘em, these things, you know the peddlers isn’t it, you didn’t have the….</p>
<p><em>Come to think of it, you’d wind it with your arms?</em></p>
<p>Yes, you didn’t have the, this sort of thing. That was one the big, on the big lake.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You had all, all those sort of things on the big lake. But in the childrens end, you had childrens, but, and then you’d say “number two comin’ in!” [laughing].</p>
<p><em>And did people used to go in? Or did they try and stay on a bit longer?</em></p>
<p>No, no, you’d, you’d, you’d go in until they called your number [laughing] God, I know that face. Don’t think who it is.</p>
<p><em>I can tell you, unless you want to guess?</em></p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p><em>It’s Anna Neagle.</em></p>
<p>That’s it. She lived in Barking.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>She used to go, she was trained at da-, my dance at, at Maude Well’s dancing school.</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>Yeah maudwell, when she, hav-, I knew, see I knew her face! Terrible when you get old, you can’t remember names. And erm, yes she erm, when she had her, “This Is Your Life”, on there. My teacher that I was trained with, Maude Wells, she was up there with her.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Yeah, Anna Neagle, she, that’s where she did all her, her dancing training.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever meet her then?</em></p>
<p>Yes I did, but she wasn’t anything when I met her, you know when, you, you, ‘cause you’re all in a show together, you know what I mean. Oh this is where they, they grow the flowers. Right lovely, there that’s the year I, I got married. And some of my flowers come from there.</p>
<p><em>Ok </em></p>
<p>So you’ve got married in 1948, ‘48, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did you know any of the nursery staff at barking, any, any p-, sort of particular characters?</em></p>
<p>Well, my mother did rather than I you know? Oh, I mean Alf knows them all now.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Bein at the park. [pause] See that p-, 1910, that’d be the year [pause] my mum got married in19-, 1915. Now, there’s the, that’s how it was, the boat lake, look.</p>
<p><em>Oh right so that’s how you remember it as well?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Would you mind describing it to me as remember it for the tape? Is that ok? Or is that?</em></p>
<p>I can’t, it, it was a place where they had all, things up and the boats were hanging up in there, you know?</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Very difficult to remember things isn’t it? And they had the oars, all ,all, all, all along one wall.[pause] Oh that’s the entrance at the erm, err, Ilford side isn’t it, Ilford lane.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I think that’s the, the Park Avenue Entrance?</em></p>
<p>That’s, that’s the, yeah that, er, no, in, in the main, main road.</p>
<p><em>Oh is it?</em></p>
<p>Yes, look, it’s the lake.</p>
<p><em>Oh of course. Yes.</em></p>
<p>That, that ti-, you know erm, when you go in, you see, you walk round that en-, when you come down Ilford Lane, you go in there and you walk round there and you walk right round and erm, Ohh that was one of our walks. Oh there’s the anti aircraft guns….Have you got any with the, with the erm, on that, the park house thing in it. Oh you haven’t got any photos of the, of all the erm….</p>
<p><em>That’s actually the…</em></p>
<p>K-</p>
<p><em>The only picture I’ve managed to find of any guns in Barking Park, which is why I’m so interested in what you can remember of it. Yeah there were quite a few there. </em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>And, and how many would you say there were do you think, approximately?</em></p>
<p>Ohh, I’d say about 4, 5, but as i-, I’ll tell you what, when I was, I was, I was going from, as I say, our house was burnt because they, they used to go, because the guns were there you see.</p>
<p><em>mmhmm </em></p>
<p>And they dropped all the, incentries along erm, [kmt], Longbridge road.</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So, my, my mum was teaching the piano there, you see, and erm, all, all, I can see it now. Beautiful orange carpet, er white furniture she had and orange. And all I can remember is the lovely white and orange. My beautiful room, the bay room, bay window and being dragged out of it because it was all a fire. You know, it, that’s all I can remember much about that.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I can remember this beautiful orange, orange carpet in, it was thick and lovely you know. Errr, ‘cause my father had been err, working with somebody in Faircroft Hotel in London. And all this erm, stuff was all over. Hmm, he offered it, you now, my Dad to buy, my Dad said oh we’re moving in to a new house that’d be great. You know. And we had this lovely, and everything was so light, and so clear and mum had done lovely curtains you know xxx xxx, beautiful! It was orange, it was sort of, it was orange yeah, I did sunny, to di-, you can see it in your eyes, but you can’t describe it.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>It really was beautiful, with all the white as well. You know. But erm, no the guns were there, and then the erm, and then they had er lorries, ‘cause they had lorries with Ack, Ack guns on the back, did you know that?</p>
<p><em>Oh no I didn’t.</em></p>
<p>And they run along Longbridge Road. [Pause] We had erm, yeah.</p>
<p><em>That’s really interesting</em></p>
<p>I think i-, i-, oth-, other than, c-, if-,there, can you get any of the papers? The old papers that..?</p>
<p><em>No, but that is, it would be my next port of call I think. </em></p>
<p>I mean, as I say, what I’m telling you may not be, a hundred percent, only as I say saw it.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>At that time.</p>
<p><em>Which is what I’m interested in, so that’s good.</em></p>
<p>Yeah you see, when, when I, I, we, erm, when I, we came back ‘cause my mother had to come back for something, or the other you know, and I never, I was always with my mum. You know because my brother was a, in the navy, and my dad was on the, you know, in the airfo-. He wasn’t in the air force but he was on all the air force stations. And erm, I came back, and we stayed with my Granddad. In my Granddad’s house in erm, St Paul’s road. And cause you know, there was a big Arwight’s there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Did you know? The big Arwight’s? Yeah. And that, ever since they’ve moved from there because there’s a special well. Did you know in, Arwight’s…</p>
<p><em>I didn’t know that</em></p>
<p>Oh I went in and saw it all and they just tellin’ me all about, ‘cause I was just nosey.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>And this well was a special well and it made the erm, as why the er, Arwight’s erm, lemonade was really super. Because of the, what ever was in this well, but you know the, all the things that were in the water in the well really made it superb. Stu-, I mean, I, I’m sure if you, you know, got any other old person in, in Barking they’d tell you all the, you know all the same. And then when we first moved there the, the horses used to come out, when we, you know, I used to come visit Nan and Granddad. They um, horses used to come out with all the erm, Arwight’s you know, all the, all the things on it….</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>All the barrels and the thing, you know. They were bringing out of there [laughing].</p>
<p><em>That’s lovely.</em></p>
<p>That was in St Paul’s road. Uh, so as I say, as I, I was telling you a story, when we’re living there, I used to get the bus because I, my education had been so, bad, my, I had got in to the Royal Ballet, it no-, it wasn’t the Royal Ballet that, it was the erm, err, oh god, can’t think it was, find out where, if the Royal Ballet was before [laughing]. It was the wells, wells something or the other, I can’t remember now. And I had got err, a scholarship in to it, you see, in to the ballet.</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>And erm, err, but my Dad said, I had to have, if I wanted to go in to the ballet school, I had to have, erm, err training, because if I was made injured, I would have to be able to earn money. You know and live sort of thing, ‘cause you don’t know, i-, what the injuries gonna be do you? In the ballet, you know in the old days it was, it wasn’t, there was no erm, you know you musn’t do this and you musn’t do that in the old days [laughing]. All the scenery fell down and nobody worried, they’d be, got, got on with it, you know. But erm, no, so my dad said I got to do short hand typing and katometer, so of course when I came back to London and I was doing exams, erm, errr, my mum put me in to the err, Abbey, err, not-, South East Tech to do short hand typing and Kantom-, kantometer! I didn’t do it for long mind you. I mean I could, you know could write, I could write all that in short hand once upon a time.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>But erm, not today.</p>
<p><em>I could probably be able to do with, you know, could do with that couldn’t i? Those skills.</em></p>
<p>[Laughing] I know, you would, you see in those days, you always managed that you, you learnt something and did something that you could go to work. Whereas today is how can I get out everything? And [laughing] majority, not saying you. But any how erm, [clears throat] and ga-, we were er, friend of mine, Pauline and I we were going to the South East Tech and as we were driving down in the bus, all the guns went off at the siren had gone. ‘cause nothing stopped when the siren went you know, everything carried on. Life carried on and all these guns were bah, bah, bah, bah, we jumped out our skins! [Laughing] came past the park and th- [laughing] we got up the road, there was another one coming down the road, bahuhuhuhuh [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Oh crikey</em></p>
<p>Oh you [laughing]</p>
<p><em>I think I would have been terrified </em></p>
<p>[laughing] yeah, but you see the point of it is what you had to be careful of, was that, if there was anything, you know, machine gun an- or anything, it was all the shells, also, you see, one of them hit you they they’re burning hot, but erm, you know, you could get quite damaged you know [laughing] with just ho--, but no it erm, you was frightened, but you got on with it. It, it, I know, you know it sounds so strange, I mean like, later on in life, in the d-, I used to go and, errr, I worked with erm, you know, a crowd of erm, oh what’s in band, little man erm, [sings] oh to be la da dad a dee a buzzee bee. Oh what’s his name?... Arthur Askey.</p>
<p><em>Ah ok. </em></p>
<p>And erm, we were doing the, going round entertaining the people in the undergrounds. You know, and erm, it, it, it was a just wonderful spirit. The you know, all the people used to do all this. Go and, ‘cause you, you know, all the undergrounds were all beds.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, shelters basically</em></p>
<p>All double beds, you know erm, all people there and some people sleeping , down on the floors. It, there were just solid. And then, i-, if, ever night when they stopped the trains, some of ‘em, even lay down in the, on the line![laughing] I d-,</p>
<p><em>Crikey.</em></p>
<p>When I first saw that I thought my god, they’ll kill, ‘cause that’s the electricity [laughing].</p>
<p><em>Don’t be rolling in to that in the night. Do you?</em></p>
<p>No, no but they shut off the electricity I think over night, and you got all the kids running up and down, you know, I mean today, with all this, you musn’t do this, they musn’t do that, you know..</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I think that, that is what is killing this country off. I really do. ‘cause there’s no discipline, no nothing. I mean, you know, if gr-, “If I told you Johnny to come here once!” Wallop, wallop, wallop, wallop! “Now sit down there and you move off back seat and I’ll kill you!”[Laughing]. You know [laughing]….you look, you look aww, poor little soul you think yeah, you know. He’s only playing with all the other kids!</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But that is how they were, weren’t they?</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I mean if todays children had a bit of that, they wouldn’t be like they are, would they? You know I mean, I know there’s a lot of people that go right over the top. But at the same time, i-, it….</p>
<p><em>Needs to be a happy medium, doesn’t there.</em></p>
<p>Yes. I mean, you know, t-, she didn’t hurt him, she was just, you know walloping him up here you know.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>[laughing] xxxx I could see her fear because, he was right near the lines. But erm, you know, it’s a different world. Oh I wish I had some of these. But as I say we went by there and the guns were bahbahbahbahbahbahbah [laughing].</p>
<p><em>Were there barrage balloons actually in Barking Park as well then? Can you remember? </em></p>
<p>I can’t remem-, I, I think there were, over, over a bit</p>
<p><em>Ok </em></p>
<p>but there was one in erm</p>
<p><em>Denham</em></p>
<p>In Blake Avenue</p>
<p><em>Oh Blake Avenue</em></p>
<p>At the end of Blake Avenue, yeah. Although, they were all over the place. They were oh, oh, where ever there was a bit of green, you know they had to have the green to, to put all the equipment and everything on. And erm, you know they, I know there definitely was one at the, at the end of the road ‘cause it come down in our garden, number 19 [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Do you know how many troops were stationed in Barking Park? Could you give an approximate estimate?</em></p>
<p>Yes there was, I don’t know, I really don’t know.</p>
<p><em>Ok,ok.</em></p>
<p>You know because erm, parts of it you couldn’t go in to the park.</p>
<p><em>Right ok.</em></p>
<p>You know where, wherever they were, but as, as I remember you couldn’t, erm…There was lots and lots of things that were out of bounds because of the danger isn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Mmmm</em></p>
<p>But I mean when you’ve got the bombers coming over, and the noise, wrrm, wrrm, wrrrm, wrrrm, you know the noise was unbelievable, and then when you hear a bomb go brrzzzzzzz, and the xxx are comin’ this way [laughing]. I’ll tell you something really funny. That I, we, I, we always laugh at it. In, I was about 14 I think and my Aunties come down from Wales, because my granddad had died. And my Granddad in St Paul’s Road, wouldn’t have a dug out in the Garden, he had one of these errr, indoor erm, things, what did they call them, they were like a, a big metal steel table, table thing.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Erm, it was indoor erm, air raid shelter. It was, it was, like this, big like that, err, at the bottom there, there was a sort of a spring and then up here, was big, in the corners, there was big thick metal corners there. On each side and then when you got in there was erm, met-, er, at the top here where you, you’d get sort of all the metal mesh sort of thing. And then when you got in there, there was all mesh that you could push up, so that nothing would fall in there, if the house got hit. Well my Granddad, had died you see, and my Auntie came up from Wales and she’d, she’d not seen any of the, any bombing or anything. ‘cause where they come from, Aberystwyth, they, they hadn’t been anything you see. And erm, she came there and she was as white as a ghost cause the air raid had gone and she said to erm, mum, “well lets go in to the thing” she said “Well Dad you know, Dads on the top of it, they’d laid his coffin on the top.” So any way she said “Well Dad never did us any harm when he was alive, lets go, you know, let us get under there.” So any way, we get unt-, undter-, in to the, you know, in to the, the shelter thing under there and there’s my mum, my Auntie Gladys and me sitting there and, and the bombing was really heavy [laughing]. My Auntie was nearly dying with it, I mean poor soul, I really feel sorry for her. And then I started laughing, I couldn’t stop laughing when I heard these bomb, and she said “Oh Jay” she said, “Why you laughing? Is that laughing matter xxxx? Terrible!” she said. How can you say, daren’t laugh,” So I said “Well Auntie Glady’s I’m just thinking, if the house gets the bomb, down, here and you know, the house is smashed up,” I said “When the wardens come in, they’ll start digging and looking for us, they’d say “ Aye it’s alright here mate! They’re already in their coffins [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>[laughing] and My Auntie didn’t think it was funny! [Laughing]</p>
<p><em>It’s amazing the kind of comedy that runs through your head xxxx</em></p>
<p>[laughing] that’s what I’m saying [laughing] I just sort of, if, I mean could you have seen them oh you know digging out somewhere and oh mate we’ve found a coffin here we don’t have to worry much here they’re already in, in ‘em. I just thought it was funny!</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>That’s my sense of humour. My mum was crying with laughter and my auntie was crying because she thought it was a terrible thing [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Oh bless her.</em></p>
<p>It shows you, how terrible b-, the Williams can be you see.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>And er, no but it was bad, it really was bad...I mean and another thing happened in Barking was erm, I can’t remember the names of the roads, it was it, Gascoigne road, and then off Gascoigne road it was, I don’t know if it was Bythen street or what have you, but as you get down St Paul’s Road, you’re in Gascoigne Road and then if you cross over where the catholic church is now you know, on the other side of the road they’re all houses and then be-, at the back of them there was another lot of houses, and I can’t think of the name of the road it was. Well a land mine dropped on these houses, and it was the biggest bang that you could ever hear, the land mines when they dropped the land mines. Well when we erm, got out in the morning you know, in the morning everybody got out to see what damage was done. And of course people were coming down and they said “corr you’re ought to see, I can’t think of the name of the roads. And erm, it said oh it’s terrible, so of course we went down there to see what had happened and when we got down there, you know, it sort o-,start standing on the sort of road where the erm cat-, opposite to the catholic chur-, you know the catholic school is now. Over where these houses were there was five, was seven h-, seven was a name, er no I think there was five. The upstairs part had been lifted up, turned round, and dropped down again. So that the people lived that end were now livin’ that end, and the people that end [laughing] they just, the bedrooms of the houses, and er, I, I’ve asked everywhere if anybody had got a photo of that. Because it was some, you see didn’t have televisions and that, that showed you those sort things in those day, but I can remember, I was fascinatin’, I had to keep going looking at it. And I thought well, how the people gonna sort out where, where they're upstairs xxxxx, but no...</p>
<p><em>It must have been quite a sight</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah, I mean ter-, that was terrible and another one, another land mine dropped on, down near scruttons farm</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>There was another landmine down there but, that was something that, it was so rare, so weird that i-, it just stayed in your mind. And I can remember one night I used to da-, I was dancing up at the stage door canteen, you know up in erm, Charing Cross. And erm, nine times out of ten we had to walk home you know but we’d walk, start...</p>
<p><em>Xxxx Charing Cross</em></p>
<p>No you’d start walking you see and erm, there’s always err taxis running back to their home or, or busses running back to the esta-, and they would take you so far down the road and then they’d be th-, somebody else, and my friend she lived, erm, the other side in you know, in, in North Street. And I was going back to St Pauls Road. And erm, so finally we’d get somebody and we’d just have to walk that last little bit you know. But it, it was fantastic, the way, you know, the bombing and everything. And when you come out. We came out of there, this night and the whole of the Thames was a fire.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>I mean I was only young then. Because erm, [mumbling], I dunno if I was thirteen and fourteen, I know you know and world wars had, had, was putting on this show, but the whole of the, you know, it was all, you couldn’t believe the amount of, of damage [car horn] that was done you know and before that, the whole of the err Thames had been af-, you know, a fire. And of course everything in there was all the storage, the food, and everything, and you know we really was badly damaged d’you know, that is why I’m so sad now, that Newham, and all those places that really were the “East Enders”, that really, really suffered in the war. They’ve all had to move out because these people have come in and pushed them out. And I think that is so cruel! And now when you hear that they're putting up shear law down there, you know people of my age are sick with it because they’re, that, all those sort of people, all from there, down to Barking and Dagenham really, is where the lot, you know really copped to it really badly. ‘Cause they used to follow the Thames along you see. And then when they had finished bombing, if, when they got, got out, they got down to near Southend up, like Hockley where we were, that is when they used to empty all their bombs on the, on the farm land.</p>
<p><em>[Right]</em></p>
<p>They wouldn’t go back with any bombs in ‘cause Hitler might be counting them [laughing]</p>
<p><em>So you wouldn’t, you know wouldn’t even been safe out there then, really</em></p>
<p>Well it was, yes it really was because, there were only landing on soft earth</p>
<p><em>Right ok</em></p>
<p>Majority, they dropped them there or in the sea you see it erm, err it err, and also the times that the, them, then they come the Doodlebugs. I think Barking had a few you know, bombs in, in, in Barking Park. I’m sure they did. I, I seem to reme-, it was, I know there was one night when they just dropped loads and loads of incendiaries to get all the place of fire so that they could see where they were going....But erm, no and then after the war there was all, every road had a, a party. And then after that, you know, Barking began to pick up and swing and that is the years, you know when we had all these wonderful carnivals, and we’ve had some lovely people dow-, have you, have you read all the different people we had, we had Diana Dors who wanted to go, ‘cause we got stuck up with the traffic, she wanted to get out of the taxi and go home [laughing] and old Maisie, that is Jack erm, oh what’s his name, Jack what’s er name’s? Wife. She used to get back in there, you’re bein’ paid for this [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>Oh and then we, we, we had some lovely men as well you know, I get, you know once upon a time I could’ve to you all the names and everything but as you get old</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They all get the names, I can sit here of and evening tonight, I’ll sit here and I’ll think of ‘em all ....</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>...and I’ll sit, have to sit and write them all out, because, when you’re talking, you can see everything, you can see them clearly, but names, just don’t come. And I was co-, complaining the other day to the doctor, you know saying about, how was it, you know, I can remember everything that sort of happened and what have you and nine times out of ten you can remember the different names and what have you people. And I said then, another day when you’re wanting to tell somebody something, you can’t remember them. He said no, he said all your years and all the things you’ve done xxx, he said it, you got to remember brain is a computer</p>
<p><em>Right </em></p>

I mean his, his legs haven’t been too bad, and he got to climb, he, I’ve been waiting actually for our lad to come down here, young Aiden. And he’ll get under and get everything out for me. And erm, I more likely have got, got there with, we did some wonder-, his first of all, it used to start from the Russian waters, that was the Carnival you know the where it first started. Then it went from there, down to erm, Mauvers Lane in the Mauvers Lane you know that way.</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>And then it finished up in Maysbrook Park and it used to come right the way round. And I’ll tell you what, there was hundreds of people, you know Barking was absolutely loaded with people on the carnival day. Was such a lot of people you know about and doing so, then Tommy H-, Holland would have the Fair, you know Tommy Holland do you?</p>
<p><em>It’s a name that’s been mentioned to me a few times...</em></p>
<p>Yeah, he, he</p>
<p><em>Did you know Tommy Holland personally?</em></p>
<p>Very well yeah, very well</p>
<p><em>Could you describe him to me?</em></p>
<p>He, he was a big man ....and err, he fough-, if Tottenham was playing at home, he wouldn’t be there on Carnival afternoon.</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>He’d been in Tottenham, him and his son. Tommy and young tommy. No they were lovely be-, and they used to have their caravan in beautiful big caravan in the erm, park. Really lovely. And they used to do a lot of ho-, hospitality there you know, we’ll go and have a drink and something to eat and something you know. It’s lovely. Erm....ssss</p>
<p><em>That, that time you were telling me about, about earlier when you won ten shillings.</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s when I was eight</p>
<p><em>Erm, yeah</em></p>
<p>I get...in</p>
<p><em>What was that for? Could you tell me about that?</em></p>
<p>Err, I can’t remember exactly what the year was....I mean I don’t know if it was that one but there was a, they were putting up, I think it wa-, down, the thing there was then, I’m sure it was. Erm, it was just er, a talent competition.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And erm....</p>
<p><em>Can you remember what you did?</em></p>
<p>Yes, erm, [sings] on the good ship lollipop</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>One of them yes, I’m sure that was the one. And the other one, that I, when, when you was [sings] in my sweet little alice blue garden, that’s another one, I won for [laughing]</p>
<p>[laughing]</p>
<p>[sings] Dedidididi down, I’m so proud, I’ve got no voice left, I was shouting at the kids all those years. Erm..</p>
<p>And where, where would they hold the presentation ceremony? For the prizes?</p>
<p>I it, on the, on the th-, on the thing. In the thing.</p>
<p>Oh in, in the actual band stand its self...oh ok</p>
<p>That stand its self. Yes every, I mean there were people singing, there were people telling jokes, and there was all different things you know. It was all, all d-, er, I don’t know what this special occasion was, for when I got the erm, ten shilling note. I, I d-, I ca-, really can’t remember. I know people used to do things and you just go, I mean, I did it there and then I went down to Southend er later on you know, bit late on in life and er, I, I won there as well, I got another ten shillings [laughing]</p>
<p>Oh really</p>
<p>And what did I sing there? I remember? Erm, Oh god. What’s the one I did down there? Ohhh it was an American song, I know. I can’t remember. It will come to me. But erm, no its erm, as I say, that was at the time of that erm, you know and that was. I think that’s so gorgeous to see that. And that was beautiful, that house. and it was always kept so beautiful and the gardens were absolutely wonderful. And that was the park we go-, you know the head of the park used to live there.</p>
<p>Erm, is actually the, the photograph we gotten in here, of erm, Les Taylor. [cough] excuse me sorry, Les Taylor who worked in the Nurseries. He actually lived in the house in 1950</p>
<p>That’s it, that’s what I’m saying, yeah..... that’s lovely, and you see Maysbrook Park also had one very similar.</p>
<p>Oh but they had a boat house as well did they?</p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>They had a boat house as well at Maysbrook Park.</p>
<p>Yes, they had a nice mays-, yeah.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Yeah, but I mean there was more trees and that at down there when, and you see they erm, the, what's the name boat, use to stand just there.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>I think actually, after a while, erm the karate, or somebody use to took over the boat houses and did, did something in them. I did, is it..</p>
<p>I, I had, I had heard..</p>
<p>I’d heard of that.</p>
<p>...of that yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They used to have karate lessons or something</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, yes. And this used to be packed solid.</p>
<p>I was going to ask you about the Lido actually, can you, can you remember the first occasion that you went there?</p>
<p>Well when I was a child, when I was a child yes, my brother took there, and, and he took me in the water, and when my mother arrived, she’d drag me out</p>
<p>[laughing]</p>
<p>‘ cause bein as I was a dancer, and doing ballet, I wasn’t allowed to swim, ride a bike, swim ride a bike or horse ride.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>‘cause you’re using all the muscles that you don’t want to build.</p>
<p>Ahh ok.</p>
<p>They infect.... I know that man....[pause]...He’s chased us away, but I’m sure xxxx than that, it’s a wonderful. The old lido.... you see that was the children’s paddling pool.</p>
<p>Err, yes.</p>
<p>If you went round there, us mums used to sit round there with the toddlers you see and they could go in there and be there all day long.</p>
<p>And the paddling pool was free, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Yeah that one was free, u paid to go in there. And also you, you’d only got mum’s and young children all round there, you know, and erm, in there, it was, everybody dashing around like mad. I, I don’t, I don’t remember seeing boats like that, I reckon that was specially done for her because they used to be a little rowing boats.</p>
<p>I think somebody else said to me that they must of brought in that dinghy just for that occasion.</p>
<p>That yeah because</p>
<p>Because they couldn’t remember</p>
<p>No, no</p>
<p>Dinghies</p>
<p>They was all wooden, rowing boats. Yeah. It...</p>
<p>So of course you would have only been two years old during the charter celebrations wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>’31, yeah, I’d only been young.</p>
<p>So you probably don’t remember the charter celebrations?</p>
<p>No, I bet my family wills, all took part in it.....[pause].... see, you can’t see the gardens here very well can you. This was 31wasn’t it, that was before all the beautiful gardens were down wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>And there is something built there then isn’t there?</p>
<p>I think a lot of the structures in that picture are probably temporary ones just for the celebrations.</p>
<p>Yeah just for that day.</p>
<p>That was when it was made a borough when the King come down.</p>
<p>That’s right yes.</p>
<p>Ha! Got photos, don’t know if I’ve got it, or my Aunties taken it. I‘ve got a photo of my, my mum, my nan and Granddad, with the ki-, you know along by the King.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>And when the mayor yes.</p>
<p>That’s wonderful, I’d love to see them if you’ve got...</p>
<p>I don’t know if I, you see my Auntie, my Auntie fi-, died, my, my c-, Nan and Granddad, my mum’s mum and dad. She h-, they had eight children.</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>My dad’s family they’d eight or nine children. And erm, the point of it is, my Auntie eth-, Auntie b-, Mabel, erm, and Auntie Floss, they were twins. And they were going to Australia and she wanted to show or borrow them, borrow them, to show somebody that had, from Barking, over in erm, Perth.</p>
<p>Oh, ok.</p>
<p>So she took them back and promised then to send, bring them back the next time, but of course. You lend some things to people you don’t get them back do-, that is the main trouble with you know hanging on to things, you loan them to people. But what else went? There was other things that went on in, in the, you know, all the schools used to go there to have their racing.</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>All the lines would be down, you know, on, on, when you see, you use to have your schools racing day. And then you used to have all the schools er, and an inter thing in between all the schools, d’you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Like an inter schools sort of thing.</p>
<p>Inter school...yeah. The children that won, there, say like if I, I won when I was at Ripple, well then it be all the schools. I, I’d go in to that one for Ripple School in to the park.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>It, it was like a, I don’t know what you call it. A special day. Wish my mum was here because she could tell you so much more.</p>
<p>[laughing]</p>
<p>You know, I mean, she, she runs such a lot</p>
<p>Mmmm</p>
<p>Whereas I was always busy working or something, d’you know what I mean? Mum and, and the whole family were all sort of tied up in it, some way or the other my, my mum, as I say our lounge at, at my, you know, my mum, was always laid out, with all chairs all round it because the people comin’ in for meetings for the Labour party.</p>
<p>I heard, erm, someone told me that in erm, I think it was 1956 the, all the trade unions and the area had a big meeting in Barking Park.</p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>Do you remember anything like that ever happening?</p>
<p>I do, there was several things that happened like that.</p>
<p>Oh right ok.</p>
<p>There was...</p>
<p>Actually in Barking Park its self?</p>
<p>Yes, I think there was..[pause]...i sort of remember it, remember it and you know, erm, see my Dad didn’t work down here, so that, I think it was all the, you know the Ford people and everybody from all that had a big erm, I d-, Alf wasn’t there in, yes he was there in the 1950s, he was at Fords. He worked, he started at Briggs and then they, Ford’s took over the whole of it..</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>...he was in the office there. yeah erm....</p>
<p>And thats</p>
<p>Is that...</p>
<p>Briggs Motor company isn’t it?</p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p>Its c-, it was called Briggs Motor Company</p>
<p>Briggs Motor Company, yes and then that went over to erm, Fords took ‘em over or because Briggs made all the erm, they did all the covering, I don’t know what they did. Don’t ask me.</p>
<p>[laughing]</p>
<p>I d-, I used to go in and out you see, ‘cause I was so busy then, you know, teaching and, and I use to go round and choreograph shows you see.</p>
<p>Oh ok</p>
<p>So that, I was so busy that I really...</p>
<p>Didn’t pay that much attention to cars [laughs]</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Weren’t that interested.</p>
<p>No, well, that is the point, isn’t, you erm, you hear, my da-, hear, hear it but it, when you’ve got a, a brain that’s buzzing with this, that and the other you, you...</p>
<p>Other things you find, you find more...</p>
<p>Yeah you’d....</p>
<p>...interesting...</p>
<p>.....It don’t, it don’t click. As I say, I, I can hear it click but erm, that’s as far as I ..</p>
<p>I understand..</p>
<p>You know I...</p>
<p>My husband works in computers and you can imagine that goes in...</p>
<p>Ohhh</p>
<p>...one ear and out the other with me so ....</p>
<p>Does he? Whereabouts does he work?</p>
<p>Um, somewhere in central London just down by Euston I think it is where he works, but</p>
<p>Ohhh</p>
<p>I don’t get computers....</p>
<p>I’ve got...</p>
<p>..so errrr....</p>
<p>..I’ve got, I’ve got a computer up there and it’s a...</p>
<p>You’re doing better than I am.[Laughing]</p>
<p>Just that, ohh yes, I use all the computer, do all the minutes and everything on the computer but erm, you know, er I’ve just got a new one. Just come in and it’s got to be connected to xxxx.</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>I’m dreading it, it w-, we put it on once</p>
<p>Should I send him round [laughing]</p>
<p>Yeah, ehh, they put erm, he put it on, they put it on and b- eh, I’d just before, erm, you know, the, we close for the summer. Beca-, the centre we, we close for the month of August</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Because, most of the things that we run are elderly people and they're minding the children during the summer holidays arn’t they you see, so we don’t get them during the day. A lot of the evening act-, like St Johns and all those people, they are, they’re still in. But erm, err, the erm, you know that is the point. We did-, we don’t, we don’t get them. So, the old brain, though, doesn’t err, really work, what was I telling you about?</p>
<p>Xxxx,</p>
<p>Erm...</p>
<p>Sorry I was just gonna ask you erm, you, you have children of your own? Yes?</p>
<p>That’s my daughter</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>Our daughter, she, that photo was taken a week after that photo was taken she died.</p>
<p>Ohh very sorry.</p>
<p>She’d got cystic fibrosis. And my son is, shes, she’s just holding his hand in er, in xxxx sister’s wedding and err, his er, BT director.</p>
<p>Ok. Did you ever take him an-, both you-, you know your children down to the park to, to play?</p>
<p>Oh they were always down there yess, yeah. Ian did lots swimming down there, they wanted to use him for, for swimming but errm, my son would not do anything [laughing] they wanted him to do.</p>
<p>[laughing]</p>
<p>And Lin was to, I mean Lin loved it there because erm, you know with her bad chests, you know and everything, sh- she could breathe in the park with all the trees and all that yeah. No, I mean, I’ve done lots of things, cabarets and that in the park you know for different things.</p>
<p>Could you, could you give me an example of one of those cabarets?</p>
<p>Erm, yeah, erm, what did, what was it for? It was for a special occasion, we did, we did some, number, I can’t remember now, what it was for. And then you see, we did it once, there and then err, all of a sudden it was taken to Dagenham town show.</p>
<p>Oh ok</p>
<p>And they did all the you know where we started something here, somebody, I think it was erm, Jack, Jack actually, pinched it. What was his name Jack Thomas.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>I think he pinched it for the Dagenham Town show.</p>
<p>Oh no</p>
<p>So that, that afterwards they tried to keep the Barking Carnival totally different to the Dagenham Tow-, Town Show, and I think, we did a cabaret, where did we do it? I don’t know, we had a stage put up and everything. It was qu-, it was good, and they had some, a couple of comedians come down. I don’t know, i-, if I go through photos, it’ll all come, come back but, no doubt people in barking will remember it. But it was in during the carnival week, you know Carn-, Carnival week. I mean you had the carnival on the Saturday, and then the fair and that was all there for the week and then the last day. They’d have a, erm, a fireworks display.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Did you know that?</p>
<p>I didn’t know that no.</p>
<p>They used to, yeah, years ago. And that, that was the finish of the, and then the, the following day the erm, what's er name work, oh left.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Tommy and all his apparatus left. He, he was a great chap. He lived in erm, near Isle of Sheppy.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>I’ve been to his house. Yeah. Hmmm</p>
<p>Ok, Hmm, what about with erm, obviously when you first met your husband, erm in sort of late 40s..</p>
<p>He comes from, he comes from Islington.</p>
<p>Oh right so do-, you never took him to Barking Park?</p>
<p>Oh yes! I’ve got loads of photos of us</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>Whe-, when we got engaged, walking along with the dog [laughing]</p>
<p>Actually in Barking Park.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll, I’ll find it for you, yeah, eh, erm...</p>
<p>So, is that the kind of place that...</p>
<p>Oh I know! The round table, they were the boys that did a lot of work at Dagenham, at Barking erm, carnival. And they did lots of things in the park, the round table. They were excellent.</p>
<p>Ok [pause].</p>
<p>But no, b-, by, and I mean, you, you, they’ve been some nice erm, you know, they’ve replaced haven’t they, all the erm, cenotaph there thing. Sort of thing, all the names of my-, I've got two uncles on that, Williams. You know on the people that died in the first world war.</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>There’s all their names up there. but then, nobody’s put anybody that died here in, in the last war.</p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p>Yes, that is the first world war</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>‘cause I w-, as I say, I’ve got two William, uncle, Williams, uncle Horace and uncle Ralf-, will up on the erm, up on that new thing, and d’you know what? Alf, ‘cause you know Alf’s all tied up with the Bowling. People have come over there, all, especially the black people, like to go there and have all their wedding photos taken by that, by that erm, I call it the cenotaph, ‘cause it, you know, it, it looks like somewhere, it’s special doesn’t it and the cenotaph is all xxxx, but no, they, they come, and now, they drive up and just think they’re can walk in the bowls club and have their photo taken on the green!</p>
<p>Crikey! [laughing]</p>
<p>Oh it’s a nightmare, it’s a, but is idiotic what’s happening now in that park.</p>
<p>What is it, about it, that’s idiotic do you think in your opinion?</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I’m hearing it all the time. In the community centre, you see, some of the people there go tennis, and some you know, xxxx they go cricket or something. And the husbands go bowling, a lot of them go bowling.</p>
<p>Mmmhmmm</p>
<p>Well, they’ve got that car park. I, I haven’t been to see it, so I don’t know what it is, what it’s like.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>You see, you come in to park and you just go in to the car park now, as Alf tells me.</p>
<p>Mmhmm</p>
<p>Well, now they’ve erm, that car park erm, if they’re, if they’re going there bowling, they can’t get in there. because so many people, come down, leave their car there all day long, and go, walk up to the station, no, no cost is there.</p>
<p>Crikey, erm.</p>
<p>An-, and it-, you know, I, I just cannot understand why nobody has done anything about it. I mean in our centre, I’m hearin’ that all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, I can only assume that eventually they’ll get wise to it and either put up a meter or something...</p>
<p>Oh it’s idiotic, ma-, allowin’ it to do.</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>I mean if the people, I mean at-, you’ve listened, I don’t know how much it is, I know they’re paying a fortune....</p>
<p><em>Hmmm </em></p>
<p>....for that hor-, for, for that green. You know, so surely they could have a Barking, they’ve always er, you know, parked there free, and I mean when they get people that come from here there and everywhere, wherever they go. They don’t have to park. They give ‘em a stick it, to stick on their car. That they are, you know, with the, the Bowls Club. Why the hell can’t Barking Park give to it, anybody that is, belongs to the Club, like the Tennis or somewhere, that they get a sticker to put on their car.</p>
<p><em>It b-, it’s a very good idea, it’s certainly sounds like xxx....</em></p>
<p>And then they would know, if, if everybody in, in that park has, has got a s-, I mean if, if your coming just for the day to play in the park, there’s a massive big errr, car park at the other end.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Why can’t they park there like we all used to? And leave the other one for the bowling and the ou-, and the tennis, and the people that playing cricket. I mean you, you try, you get a b-, the bags that they have to carry with four heavy ba-, and they're all elderly people.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>It’s idiotic, these people that have built b-, Barking, they're doing nowt for. Absolutely nowt for. All they're doing is from or everybody new that’s come in. And people that have never paid a penny to ke-, to, to get this town like it has been. I, I, I cannot understand what they're trying to do. You kn-, I think, eh, the, the, they’ve got a thing or ‘nother ‘em whatsa name puttin’ up arn’t they?</p>
<p><em>The er what sorry?</em></p>
<p>Erm, you know, the old... Didn’t they knock it down? The erm, you know, wh-, the bandstand?</p>
<p><em>Yes the bandstand was moved to make way for the oohhh, erm...</em></p>
<p>The car park</p>
<p><em>I think yeah, I think mi-, might be the car park.</em></p>
<p>The old car park that they used to have.</p>
<p><em>Right ok.</em></p>
<p>Now once again, there was something that was great to people. Why didn’t they put it somewhere in the middle of the green or somewhere, where people could all sit round and they can have a concert there. They have got no imagination! And it a picked a pound a pinch is bloody men!</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>Honest to God they’ve got no, men have got no imagination whatsoever. And, and from what I hear, from all the people, from the centre, that there’s a man there that i-, is, is, is a yes man! And he w-, he will not, you know, i-, he’ll just do what these people tell them. You don’t do that.</p>
<p><em>No, I did hear a fabulous....</em></p>
<p>You listen to the people</p>
<p><em>Sorry</em></p>
<p>Go on..</p>
<p><em>I was just gonna say, I did hear a fabulous idea the other day actually, I was interviewing someone for this project and he suggested rebuilding the bandstand on one of the islands on the lake and have them sort of playing music to all the boaters and things, and I thought that was a really lovely idea.</em></p>
<p>That’d be lov-, lovely idea, yeah, but erm..</p>
<p><em>I don’t think it’ll happen, [laughing] but it’s a nice idea </em></p>
<p>No, no I don’t think it’ll happen because erm, be mushy out there isn’t it, and they’re not terribly big.</p>
<p><em>No, no there is that</em></p>
<p>I mean it used to have all the ducks and everything there, they were gorgeous, with so many beautiful ducks and swans on that river. Are they still got them, I haven’t been there for ages.</p>
<p><em>Erm well I think obviously they left fo-, wh-, when they drained the lake, but now the lake filled back up again, I’m sure they’ll s-, they’ll soon come back. But someone was telling me they used to be quite a lot of swans there. And now..</em></p>
<p>Oh they’re beautiful</p>
<p><em>...there’s erm, more geese or something than there are swans.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, the swans were beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Were they?</em></p>
<p>Oh Beau-, and I’ll tell you what, in the childrens one they used to have swan boats..</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>... that used to sit in and you know the mums could go in with th-, for the little children, but yeah, and you say in the swan they used to have b-, swan boats, you know, with the, with the thing that you wind [laughing]. I sat there for ages, by the time you finished your arms ached like hell![laughing]</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>And you used to keep bashing in to one another. You know.</p>
<p><em>So was like bumper cars or something</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes ,yes, but as I say, it was just the end of the, it was all cut all, you know, whatsa name Don, you couldn’t go in to the big, I don’t know if it was more shallow or anything, ‘cause when you’re young you, you can’t remember those sort things can you?</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>I mean it’s deep any way if you’re, you’re young that erm, yeah, er, no, it, there was as I say, there was one for the children there. And also, if y-, you know when we got older and we were go-, we used to go round and on the road, you know, and they were nice. But er, the older ferry when they used to have people you know singing and what have you, you know you get a crowd on there, that can be great, great deal of fun going round on that. Was Barking Park quite a popular with courting couples that I know we touched on it briefly.</p>
<p>Oh yes, always, yes.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Yes and erm, I b-, it was a meeting place with the dog walkers you know and that, that have you. And all the, decent people, you know, would clear up after them. I mean many people, I mean Alf’s come home many time with a bag full but erm, you see there was no where to put it, in that, in, in, I don’t know if they’ve got any where now, that they can bins that they can put dogs mess in.</p>
<p><em>Oh, think they do have erm..</em></p>
<p>Have they got it now?</p>
<p><em>They’ve got bins specifically for that.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, ‘cause I know at Maysbrook now they have got them now.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But erm, No it, it err, you know m-, Barking Park, it was such a, a lovely, lovely park. I mean Maysbrook was always bigger and more erm, you know it’s got a big lake and it’s got all that, but it was much more, re-, it wasn’t so angelic as Barking Park. I suppose it was because such a lot went on in Barking Park for me. But err, I don’t know. It’s er, it is, it is a lovely park with the trees and when you think the years that they’ve been there and as I say if you could find a photo of the old park people that used to walk round there in their brown and green. I mean they looked absolutely smart with all their buttons and everything there you know, but it really was nice, but then in the past, I mean, Alf, with the bowling green, they’ve had all the bowling green done and then somebody had come in there and put all the, you know Asians would come in and cut all the grass up, put in no crosses you know, this is hell, hell, hell, hell and put in all their, you know their erm, Pakistani things there.</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And i-, Alf asked why the hell are you doing this, you know, your British, why are you doin-, we’re not British they shout and poor Alf, we’re pakis, he said where were you born? So he said in Ilford, so he said you’re not a Paki, you said you’d, you say to them, you’re English</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>You should appreciate and be careful what you’re doing, but ma-, majority of the trouble appeared to come from, you know, Ilford side</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>But there has been, they’ve gone down there and they’ve dug everything up and they had all electric wiring put, put round. The other day, after one of the, you know mi-, millers, they’re supposed to look after the park so well.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>And the er, a lot of the wires were pulled out from the, from the electric, you know things to stop the erm, foxes. ‘cause the foxes get on to the green and dig big holes. And it’s not happening when they’re playing with the bowls.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] </em></p>
<p>I don’t know, I just sit back and listen to that, but you know, when I hear it here and then I hear it down the centre, I think “Oh god, they all are a bit fired up here about this” you know.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But erm, no it’s a....</p>
<p><em>Do you think you’ll go down there when they have the grand reopening, down there?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes!</p>
<p><em>And all ther facilities?</em></p>
<p>If I can walk, yes.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I will be, yes. When is it supposed to be opening?</p>
<p><em>Erm, I’m not a hundred per cent sure, ithought it was sometime early next year. Erm, but as...</em></p>
<p>What for the Olympics?</p>
<p><em>..I said t-, er-</em></p>
<p>They got a hell of a lot more to do! But I mean, their parking, they must sort out.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, but i-</em></p>
<p>Because</p>
<p><em>..I, I had a, sorry, I had a sorry I had a tour of the sort of lido area which is all been re-developed, and it is looking quite good.</em></p>
<p>What have they done there? With the Lido?</p>
<p><em>Theyre making like a wet play area</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s right, yeah</p>
<p><em>With fountains</em></p>
<p>That’s a good idea, but I can’t understand, for the life of me why they took away the indoor bowls. Because they, that was a nice little thing there, and people always there, people using it, a lot of people using it, but they pulled it down, they could of carri-, you know, put that characteristic in there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But no. Typical men! Bash it all down and then you know we, we put loads and loads of people out, that have, have shear enjoyment.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, unfortunately I don’t really know too much about that. I did, er, one of my colleagues interviewed one of the chaps that used to run things down there um, and he give me a CD of a film.</em></p>
<p>Was he Chris?</p>
<p><em>Erm, I think I might have [rustling of paper]</em></p>
<p>Chris Hannibal, Hammerhall-, call-, hammer-, hammerhawk or something?</p>
<p><em>Xxx erm, [paper rustling] Brian Barnard?</em></p>
<p>Oh Brian</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Hmm</p>
<p><em>He, he gave me a copy of it. Like I said one of my colleagues interviewd him for another project. Erm, so he dropped that round very kindly for me, that was very nice of him</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s good. So what are you doing</p>
<p><em>So its nice to see</em></p>
<p>You’re making a book of all this? Are you? Or?</p>
<p><em>Erm, well Eastside Community heritage which is who I work for have been commissioned...</em></p>
<p>Who is it?</p>
<p><em>Erm I work for Eastside Community Heritage.</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>And we’ve been commissioned to the oral history aspect of the project.</em></p>
<p>How about the erm, tea house ther, is that err...</p>
<p><em>Erm, there will be a new cafe down there.</em></p>
<p>Yeah but is that, is the house still there? Because...</p>
<p><em>No apparently I heard it burnt down.</em></p>
<p>That’s a load of rubbish.</p>
<p><em>Oh really?</em></p>
<p>Well it, it, it wasn’t bought-, burnt down on, on ... it was done on purpose.</p>
<p><em>Whereabout, oh was it arson, was it?</em></p>
<p>I mean it, it was, yeh, a place there that, as a, as a child you use to go there and have your drinks and your coffee and all that, it and it really was a lovely, and the people, you know that use to run it, use to live there</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And it was always looked after and there was always people there in, in the park, you know. It was a lovely old tea house there.... have they still got the other building over the side where the er, footballers and all them change, have they still got that there?</p>
<p><em>I’m not sure to be honest</em></p>
<p>But you know where the Barking abbey school is?</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Well its over that side, right over the en-,end, there’s a building, it used to be building there that the footballer’s had and all...</p>
<p><em>It’s possibly it’s quite- </em></p>
<p>Cricket</p>
<p><em>There’s quite a large section of the park sort of cordoned off at the moment while they do all the works, so may be it’s still there but....</em></p>
<p>I mean look at the time they took to do that car park.</p>
<p><em>Mmmm</em></p>
<p>Well we were in hysterics, people coming to the centre and say “here have you seen the park, yeah, erm, ja-, Japan can do a whole road. Build it dig it up after their eh-, terrible earthquake erm, an-, after four five days the cars running along it. That took six weeks! That stupid car park!</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] oh dear!</em></p>
<p>Six weeks! What a waste of money! That is when you’ve got charity money, and it’s being wasted.</p>
<p><em>Right...</em></p>
<p>Don’t you think?</p>
<p><em>I would agree yes, that it does seem a bit extreme when like you say...</em></p>
<p>Six weeks!</p>
<p><em>When you compare it to examples where, but...</em></p>
<p>Well Japan...</p>
<p><em>I don’t know enough about it to really comment!</em></p>
<p>I mean Japan had this dreadful road that was absolutely, I mean you saw, you saw no doubt the terrible things that happened there.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>Xxxx I’ve got um, my friend’s two girls, children are over there at the minute helping, to do, to do and it’s wonderful. Um, you know, it, it was miles, miles and miles long. So that the people could get from A to say to C, and they did it in a week.</p>
<p><em>Crikey. </em></p>
<p>And when they said, Alf said, I can’t believe it. He says, six weeks, and they’re still not finished that car park!</p>
<p><em>Terrible isn’t it! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>I mean it’s absolute, and then they’ve left loads of it as grass still!</p>
<p><em>Right, so they haven’t completed the job? </em></p>
<p>Xxxx completed. But no, I mean, it has been found, four of our ladies went round there you see, and they, they all belonged to the bowls club. So they knew all the cars that were, you know, ‘cause the girl, the people had put “B” on them. So that they knew where the cars were.</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>And out of that, out of the cars that were there, the majority were people, not people coming to the park, people that had left them there because they, they were there at half past eight in the morning, you know, the park opens at eight...</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Doesn’t it? Half past eight the cars were there, and they were still there at half past five at night.</p>
<p><em>Crikey. Well it’s only a ten minute walk to the station from there though isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Well that’s what I’m saying! And you think what they pay out in car parking. But I, if they’ve got two penneth of common sense, and they don’t want a war on their hands, they will give out all the, the, you know, the cricket, and the people that, the tennis, the table tennis, if you hire a thing, you get a ticket for your car. And then do the same with the bowling. I mean in the winter, when the indoor bowling, and you get hundreds of people there.</p>
<p><em>Really?</em></p>
<p>What’s going to happen?</p>
<p><em>It’s going to get very full very quickly isn’t it? [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Well it’s not that, they’re going to get people that’ll leave.</p>
<p><em>Oh really? Ok. </em></p>
<p>Because I mean a lot of Alf’s people are getting, er, so, xxxx up on it, that there won’t be a bowling club if, if, if the council don’t do something or other, the park don’t do something.</p>
<p><em>Right. That would be very sad wouldn’t it, to see it go?</em></p>
<p>Well I mean, that is, they want this to be an old park, bowls is the most important thing on the parks.</p>
<p><em>Yeah?</em></p>
<p>Bowls and your cricket. You know, your bowls, cricket and your um, football, and your tennis, are the main things in a, that are always in a park.</p>
<p><em>Hopefully when the boating lake is back up and running, boating will become popular again, won’t it?</em></p>
<p>But I just, I just can’t see that, oh, and boating and all that, but um, I mean, they can easily park in the big car park can’t they, for the boats. Be much easier then to park there. But um...</p>
<p><em>Sorry, I was just going to ask, do you know anything about the um, light railway in the park?</em></p>
<p>Oh that, yes, that’s been there for years, and years, and years.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember going on it as a child or later?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, my daughter, my daughter would go up and down, up and down! Yes, she, she loved it! And I think all the children do. I did, yes. You know, I mean, because she was being pushed in a wheel, wheelchair, if we left you know, at the, is it, you know, they are sort of things that disabled children can do. And that’s why I think that is a necessity. ‘Cause if you leave at the, you know, at the um, where the er, what’s it’s name is, where the lake is, and the train goes along. You can run along with it, with your pushchair, and then meet them the other end. And they’re doing something individual and being, you know, doing something that they, on their own, and they can do it. Although mum’s running along the side with the pram, you know!</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>But um, it’s something disabled children can do. And how much is there in there that the dis-, and another thing is the playground. Are they putting ages on the people allowed in there, because I’ve been over there, seeing a load, a gang of Asian boys, doing everything that shouldn’t be done in that area.</p>
<p><em>Oh really? I’m not sure, I’m assuming when they open the new playground that will have an age limit or something like that, I really have no idea. </em></p>
<p>Well I think that, I know that a lot of the councils are doing that, and even, and that’s why they made them start paying to go in to do it, and I think they should have taken the money when they walked in and give it back to the mothers, parents, when they come out.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm, for good behaviour?</em></p>
<p>But er, yes!</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>If the children behave themselves! You see there’s no incentitive is there, in this, this world today. For the children. It’s honest to God, I mean, you listen to a child when she speaks to you, how often do you hear a child say thank you, excuse me.</p>
<p><em>I think it depends on where you are doesn’t it? [laughs].</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Most of the children that I have contact with are quite polite, but I, I don’t know, I suppose on a general sort of day to day basis xxxx...</em></p>
<p>If you, if you are out in a park...how, have you not heard the disgusting language and what have you?</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>I mean, I have!</p>
<p><em>I do hear some pretty shocking language but...[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>But that’s what I’m saying! You see, and if you say, I mean, the gardens at Barking Park, and Mayesbrook, are gorgeous. If I’m in there and I see something to it, my stick comes up and I point them, and I say, what are you doing on there? You have no right to be on there! Oh, get out of it, you silly old blah, blah, blah. And I say, yes, it’s very clever isn’t it, I suppose seeing as I’m old you’re going to knock me down? And I said, but I shall bloody well hit you a damn site harder before you get to me!</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>And you know, and they’re so rude! I mean, an elderly person wouldn’t speak to a person like that in our day, because in our day, the person come up and say, oh, ain’t the flowers lovely, and the children would sit and discuss them, and the, and you learnt from the elderly people, what flowers were and you know, and what they were called, and if you come home and you think, oh, I know the name of that flower! You know! But today.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>I think they’re horrible!</p>
<p><em>I think they’re doing a bit of an education initiative in Barking Park, sort of um, doing sort of nature rambles with young people and things like that...</em></p>
<p>I think that’s a brilliant idea, but also, they’ve got to have discipline while they’re doing it. Absolute disa-, discipline, because that is where it all falls down to pieces. I’m so pleased that Cameron has turned round and said, that schools have got to get -, I mean all the teachers have got their hands crossed like this haven’t they? Mustn’t do this, mustn’t do that, mustn’t shout at them. God if you, if I didn’t shout at my girls and wake them up occasionally, we’d have never got anywhere! [laughs]. I wouldn’t have all these teachers and goodness knows what! [laughs]. I mean, you, you have to raise your voice. But that, unfortunately, poor little sweets, it gives them the headache.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>You know, and I, I think discipline, um, I’d like to see all the, the car park people, be given the right to really take their names and addresses and, and you know. They’ve got to stop it, otherwise every penny that’s being paid out in that park, they got, you get a gang in there xxxx, it’ll be gone. I, I just, I just feel that um, everybody’s now got to be stand out, stood up and counted.</p>
<p><em>Definitely. </em></p>
<p>I mean hasn’t it been proved these last few weeks. It doesn’t matter whether you’ve got a lot of money or if you’re broke, you can still be very horrible. As I say it, um, you didn’t, didn’t find, xxxx did find not very nice things in that day but, I can never remember, honest to God, anybody being horrible or rude or, anything. You know, I mean um, your mum would clout you if you were [laughs] xxxx. And that’s what they don’t get now, isn’t it? You know, I mean, I mean, well that’s what we say at the centre, you know, there’s old ladies there, ninety, ninety three, and she said cor, I didn’t half have some wallops when I was younger but it’s not done me any harm has it!?</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Which is true!</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>So it really, it makes all this human rights thing, a load of rubbish. Don’t you think, honest to God?</p>
<p><em>I, I, I do think that, these days there do seem to be a lot of rules and regulations about things that I don’t think there need to be rules and regulations about, but...</em></p>
<p>But I, you, you get a person that comes here from another country, he rapes the girls, he does this, but because he’s got a wife and two children here, the judge gives him eleven months in prison instead of over a year, because if he, if he er, gives him a year, he can be deported. Now honest to God...I mean, Clegg, Gregg er, what’s his name, you know, what’s his name, Gregg?</p>
<p><em>Um...</em></p>
<p>What’s his other name, Nick Gregg, has got a lot to answer over this human rights, because no right, how about...</p>
<p><em>I haven’t heard about this...</em></p>
<p>How about the rights of the people that he, he raped. How about the rape, the er, the rights of the people that live near him? And all the trouble he causes? Haven’t, haven’t anybody else got any rights, is it just that one man that can do all these things, and because his wife and children are here, and that, like that woman that wants to bring her husband in from thing, from India, he doesn’t speak a word of English. And according to what I hear from India, you know [laughs], ‘cause my neighbour over there, he comes from a village nearby, and he’s an old man in he’s very ill, and she wants to bring him over here because he’ll, he’ll get treated in the national health!</p>
<p><em>Right. </em></p>
<p>So are we going to bring him over, allow him to come over, because it’s her human rights to have him over here? And she’s lived all these years without him. Let’s be honest about this. I, I, I sit back and I thought, God, I’ll be up there looking down, thinking there, I knew they were going to make a right bloody mess of all that! [laughs]. But it’s true isn’t it? Do you know, I mean, if you do wrong, if you do anything wrong, I mean, I firmly believe this, I mean if it happened to me, I would accept it. Because I think, if you’re doing wrong, and you’re taken to court, and you’re, you’re what’s the name, you’ve lost your rights for anything. Human rights or any rights. And therefore, if you can’t be right by living, why should you have your human rights? You know, it, it makes me so sick. I mean about those men that had all those young girls for prostitutes. They haven’t been deported because it’s not their human rights.</p>
<p><em>Crikey, no I hadn’t heard about that one either. </em></p>
<p>Well I hear about it, because you know, I know so many people.</p>
<p><em>I tend to avoid the news because it’s quite depressing so...[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, well I read it from front to back page. But you see this is the point. You see, everybody’s so busy today, they’re not, not looking at why this is all happening. It’s happening, a, because the children in school are not now being disciplined, no discipline. I mean, I’ve got a grand daughter, up there [gestures towards photo on the wall], they, them , they’re my um, son’s adopted three children. The one, the furthest one away, she’s the eldest. Now she left home at seventeen, she, I mean, they were adopted, she was five, four, three, when they were adopted. She had a terrible life there, but, then she was put in to care, and you know, in to social services. And that girl learnt how to get round the social services. Now right through up to, my son adopted her when she was six or seven, she has played with the xxxx, if, if Ian says she can’t do something or what have you, she goes straight to the social services and complains.</p>
<p><em>Oh really?</em></p>
<p>And they say yes she can do it, or no she can’t do it. And now she’s left home, she will sleep with anybody or anything. She, she’s been on the drugs. She’s done everything wrong. Everything. And that is just because social services were quite pleased to help her out, and listen to her. Wouldn’t listen to the school. Made the school be all namby pamby with her. And Ian and his wife got all the blame for everything happened. The other two kids are great. But she is just, she’s exceedingly clever. Now she’s been put in to four different homes, with you know, er, what do they call them? People who look after them you know.</p>
<p><em>Like foster care?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, foster care. And she’s been thrown out of all four. All, they, they have her for about three months, can’t put up with her a minute longer.</p>
<p><em>Really. </em></p>
<p>I mean I told her I’d always be here for her, to help her. And um, I said like, I wouldn’t have her live with me, ‘cause I’m too old and can’t you know, and she knows I speak straight from the chin. Well she came here for Easter because there, I had her over the Easter because she’d really upset the person...she came here, and she was an angel for the first day. And then she realised she hadn’t brought her charger with her, to charge her, you know, her mobile.</p>
<p><em>Right. </em></p>
<p>She turned like a er, a wild, mad, animal. And the language! I have never heard it, so atrocious, in all my life. You see?</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. </em></p>
<p>No discipline, no nothing. If they hadn’t given in, the social services...</p>
<p>Alf Groves: Would you like a tea either of you?</p>
<p><em>Oh I’m ok, thank you!</em></p>
<p>I’ll have a cup of tea please! Oh go on, have a cup of tea!</p>
<p><em>I’m alright! I still haven’t drank my water actually have I? [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Yeah. Um...</p>
<p><em>Thanks very much!</em></p>
<p>Yes that um, you know, it would be so different. And when you all get to our age and we all sit there down to the centre, I think we’re the people that should sit and tell people today what to do.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>And how to do it, because we’ve been there.</p>
<p><em>Well you’ve all got the experience haven’t you?</em></p>
<p>We’ve been there, we’ve got the T-shirt. And when you’ve been through a war, I think you see all the sides of different people. But, how people can be like that are today, I don’t...I just can’t understand. I was just telling her about Naomi, Alf.</p>
<p>AG: Oh.</p>
<p>I mean the social, haven’t they? Social have ruined her life.</p>
<p>AG: They really have. See the kids learn how to play the system.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it’s such a shame. </em></p>
<p>AG: And they get cleverer than the so-, because the social workers are always changing, they’re not with one long enough to really understand them.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>AG: So she’s played the system all the way through, and she’s very, and it’s an absolute tragedy, ‘cause she’s intelligent.</p>
<p>Very intelligent.</p>
<p><em>You were saying she’s very smart isn’t she. </em></p>
<p>AG: Yeah.</p>
<p>Very intelligent.</p>
<p>AG: Our next door neighbour, she’s a science teacher and she’s talked to her...</p>
<p>Xxxx.</p>
<p>AG: And she said, she’s an intelligent girl, but...it’s a pity see ‘cause she’d xxxx, whenever I’ve asked her any questions, I know she has the ability to sail through her education.</p>
<p>And she just won’t.</p>
<p>AG: Not up to...Masters, but the level of education, she should have just walked that without even thinking.</p>
<p><em>Anyone can do anything they put their mind to. </em></p>
<p>Yeah! But now she’s, now you see, her idea, she’s not going to work, never going to go to work. I mean she’s eighteen on the eighth of, of September. Um, she’s got engaged. And the boy is as thick as she is. I mean she’s been sent out to somewhere [laughs], where...</p>
<p>AG: Are you sure you wouldn’t like a cup of tea?</p>
<p><em>Oh I’m fine, thank you. Thank you for offering.</em></p>
<p>AG: Alright.</p>
<p>Larksfield isn’t it, she’s at?</p>
<p>AG: Larksfield, xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p>She’s gone out over to Larksfield, she’s living over at Larksfield. They’ve sent her right away from the other lady, ‘cause, she was with a lovely girl, Gaye. Lovely. She was helping her, teaching her how to cook, and keep her bedroom clean and bath and everything. And course, Naomi, had a big strop on and wouldn’t do nothing. Wouldn’t wash.</p>
<p><em>Really. </em></p>
<p>Yes. Just went out and spent all her money that she’d got, and she’s supposed to buy all her own food and everything and, you know. And then she went round, um, she went next door but one, got in the boy’s bed with him and God knows what happened. And then she tells the little sister, what happens, that she had sex with her brother, and gives her cigarettes to smoke! A thirteen year old child!</p>
<p><em>Crikey!</em></p>
<p>AG: Ten.</p>
<p>Ten, oh ten year old child. Yeah.</p>
<p>AG: She’s, she’s just, I don’t know.</p>
<p>And you know xxxx.</p>
<p>AG: Xxxx, you know, unfortunately she is past redemption. You know.</p>
<p>I think she is now.</p>
<p>AG: ‘Cause you learn as you got on in life, the Roman Catholic priest says, give me a child til the age of seven and I’ve got it for life. And that applies to everything. If you, what’s gone in to a child by the age of seven, that’s it.</p>
<p><em>Right. </em></p>
<p>AG: You know, they may, they may learn how to cover things, but no. Then, they, her, unfortunately for her she had a terrible life, and a terrible upbringing.</p>
<p>She’s a beautiful looking girl.</p>
<p>AG: Terrible upbringing xxxx.</p>
<p>Beautiful looking girl, and when she’s...</p>
<p><em>It’s very sad. </em></p>
<p>Charming.</p>
<p>AG: Ah well, that’s part of her xxxx isn’t it? It’s xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Xxxx xxxx absolutely, such a lovely girl and you know, and she’d get drunk and pick up a two year old child, and threw it!</p>
<p><em>Crikey. Oh dear. </em></p>
<p>You know, it’s almost as if...</p>
<p>AG: I take it you’ve done everything have you?</p>
<p>I think we’ve been through a lot of it!</p>
<p><em>Oh sorry! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>AG: Xxxx.</p>
<p>Xxxx xxxx</p>
<p><em>I can probably stop the tape now! </em></p>
<p>AG: Did you tell her the story of um, the indoor shelter?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>AG: Right!</p>
<p><em>It’s always good to come prepared isn’t it? [laughs]</em></p>
<p>AG: [laughs]. Oh Lord, yes!</p>
<p>We’ve had some laughs xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p>AG: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>Lynne used to love going round and round that. She said, did Lynne like the train? Used to put her there, and wheel her pram right down the end.</p>
<p>AG: Down the over end! Yeah! [laughs]</p>
<p>And pick, take her off! As I say, I think that’s good, especially for, for invalid children. And it, when you think.</p>
<p><em>Well, it still has full disabled access now which is really nice. </em></p>
<p>Pardon?</p>
<p><em>The train has full disabled access now as well. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So I think it’s even got a place for like, wheelchair users and stuff, to wheel themselves up on to it and...</em></p>
<p>Have they?</p>
<p><em>That’s what I’ve heard, I’m not, I’ve not been on it myself so...</em></p>
<p>I, I mean, for Lynne, it was just heaven, to get out of the pushchair, and be, be on something you know, properly.</p>
<p><em>Get to play on something other than her pushchair?</em></p>
<p>Her pushchair, yes, that she was really doing it properly, you know. And he’d sit the other side of her with a face like that, oh, he’s got to be on her with me, you know.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>[laughs].</p>
<p><em>But good fun though?</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah, and she loved it! She just loved it, but there you are, it’s just one of those things isn’t it? I mean, as I say, that was when she was very young, where as she got older...she was brilliant. She was a clever little girl as well. It’s just a shame isn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>But that, that’s lovely seeing, seeing that. But I will, as I say, I have got photo’s of the carnival.</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>And I have got photo’s of the, you know, where they stand, and where they all get presented with the cups because there’s all different cups you know.</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s fantastic!</em></p>
<p>That they all, have you not, never seen the carnival?</p>
<p><em>No I’ve never seen, ‘cause the thing is...</em></p>
<p>They did, they don’t, the carnival’s not like what we used to do it, is it Alf?</p>
<p>AG: No.</p>
