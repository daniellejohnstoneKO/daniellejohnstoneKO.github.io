<p><em>Could you tell me your full name?</em></p>
<p>It’s Mary Ogden just that.</p>
<p><em>Right and can you tell me when you were born?</em></p>
<p>I was born on the fourth of July 1928 in Oldham in Lancashire</p>
<p><em>Oh so you’re a long way from... </em></p>
<p>Yes you might, yes well yes that part that is why I remember Barking so well because my father was building houses not, it wasn’t his firm he was working for a gentleman who bought the land and had surveyors and one thing and another but my father was the practical one and so he was building in different areas and when ever he built we had to move with him, so we came from Oldham in Lancashire which is a few miles outside of Manchester then we went up to Cumbria into country, he build houses there and then from Cumbria we came to Barking. I was three my brother was four and another brother was seven or eight something like that. Anyway so my poor mother had to pack up the cottage where we were living in Cumbria, my father had already come down to start the estate in Barking and my mother had to pack up the cottage get everything, well there was a van obviously, and the boys came down with my father and my grandmother. My grandmother lived with us, she was in her late 70 then, and my mother and I came down on the train from Cumbria. Now I had never been in London before, my mother hadn’t funny enough, she had never been outside of Manchester or the Cumberland area, and she was terrified. I didn’t know at the time she was, to me it was a great adventure. I was 3 years old, we came to Barking, now there was six of us, three children, my grandmother, my father and mother, and we had a two bedroom house which wasn’t very convenient only because it was backing onto the building site and any spare moments that my father had, he took us all in to Barking Park</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>Which was quite a walk from where we were living in Ripple Road near Ripple Road? So from being three, Barking Park was very important to me because we were there as a family you see and everything was going on there. There were swings, there was water, I never whet in the swimming pool but my brothers did, I whet in the paddling pool, but at three I wasn’t you know up to the big lido as they called it. We went on the boats we went on the paddle boats we went into the restaurant, ice creams, the swings, it was, well it kept us xxxx and I think it gave my mother sanity to get her out into the air and away from this little cottage and the building site; we were on the building site. So Barking became very, Barking Park became very important and I was in a push chair, mind you I think I could have walked but I was lazy, and one day we went there and it was oh it so exciting there were bands, there were men dressed up, there was oh all kinds of things going on, decorations up, um streets all decorated, parties going on and oh to me I just thought it was wonderful you see and its afterwards I thought well I wonder what was going on then? Well I think it was a Charter, it must have been 1932.</p>
<p><em>Right </em></p>
<p>It was no earlier, certainly wasn’t any later I think it was 1932 and I think Barking got its charter, a charter, as a borough. Anyway there was this big do in the park and I can remember being pushed down this long avenue with beautiful trees either side and a war memorial towards the middle, and then there was the lake, but there was the mayor and all the people dressed up and there was a real party atmosphere and I never really been told what was going on but to me it was exciting and thrilling.</p>
<p><em>Yes of course.</em></p>
<p>And next time I went I was very disappointed because they had all gone, but the park was there. So that was my very first remembrance of Barking Park</p>
<p><em>Of the charter. </em></p>
<p>Now the next thing was very different because the war came in 1939, the war came and the park was closed, the South Park Drive end was closed to us, and the army moved in and they had a very large what you call it heavy anti aircraft barrack barrage, I think they called it, anyway they built a lot of brick buildings, like rough looking buildings actually they went pretty by any means but they for the troops you see now they had to live.</p>
<p><em>Oh they actually lived there</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, yes they were all there and whats more they dug huge pits to put guns in you see. The guns were set into concrete and brick, now what do you call them really, like ditches, and then of course the guns were covered up with camouflage, and they were guarding London. That was before the war started when they were planning it, they also dug a lot of trenches for people to hide in if there was bombing and they knew there was going to be bombing. And so I think the park was actually closed, if not wholly closed partially closed for quite along time about the time the war started in 1939, and so the troops moved in and that was exciting because I was 11 by that time and my mother said, “Now don’t you go to that park not with them soldiers”. You know they were much to busy to bother about me but she wasn’t to keen and so she said, “Don’t go in that park on your own”. “I’ve got the dog”. “Never mind the dog you not going in that park”. So that was it, and that was as I said the whole of the war that was you was under restriction anyway.</p>
<p><em>Was it closed all thought the war? </em></p>
<p>Not completely oh no, no, it was just while they were building that but you there was still restrictions you see, and so then in 1943 by that time, I had left school, how I got any education in the war I do not know because the schools were all evacuated at first and so on but somehow I managed.</p>
<p><em>Were you evacuated? </em></p>
<p>No never no, no my father and mother decided that if we going to get killed we would all get killed together, we had an air raid shelter, that’s why I was showing that young lady were we slept all the war and never got a cold, in the deep shelter, no. Anyway 1943 I had just started work in the city, felt so grown up, 14 and a half I was, felt so grown up to be allowed to go and work in the city. If I’d have known what it was going to turn out I’d would have stayed at school but there you are. So my friend who been to school with me all the time, we went together, if I was with Vera we walked, that meant we were early enough to walk to Barking station, but if I was a bit late or something like that we would go on the bus from Longbridge Road you see, going to Barking station but this particular day, it was a beautiful morning and we decided we would walk, and we are walking outside the park on Longbridge Road you know where the bushes are?</p>
<p><em>Yes </em></p>
<p>Well there weren’t so many bushes in those days, they were planted but they were you know small, and it was March anyway so you know there wasn’t a lot of cover, but anyway Vera and I were strolling, strutting along chatting away like ever and suddenly all hell broke loose. The guns went off, and that particular morning six German planes had got under the radar from Germany or Holland, Holland I think they come from. Holland of course by that time was of course was coved by the Germans you see, and so was France, 1943. There were only 20 miles away across the channel, we were pretty close to be invaded ourselves, but anyway this six planes smallish planes, bomber planes, they got under the radar at half past seven on a lovely sunny morning, and they were making for London, and that’s why the Barking guns where there you see to protect London, the docks, and London itself. And the guns opened up, and of course nosey here stands in the middle of the path looking and there’s this German plane so low I could see the black swastikas on the wings. Now my friend although she was the same age as I, had a lot more common sense, she shouted at me she said, “Get down you fool, get down”, and she gave me such a thump between my shoulder blades that I went down onto the verge were these shrubs were. I had no chose as I say she just gave me this great punch between the shoulder blades and there I am lying on this earth, nose to the ground, she’s by the side of me, and that noise, the sound of the aircraft, and the guns, and I suppose others. I don’t know what other noises, and I'm lying there on this ground still not realising the danger that we were in and I'm thinking that’s funny all those wormholes, where are the worms, and I’m so worried looking for these worms. They were tracer of bullet holes, we were being, we were being shot at, as we lay on the ground, because you see we weren’t covered by bushes then, now you wouldn’t see us, but it was pretty much you know clear earth, and there was I dozy as ever, saying, “That’s funny, look at those little holes all around me where they coming from and then...</p>
<p><em>Were you frightened Mary? </em></p>
<p>No, I thought to my self this is odd and I'm waiting to see what Vera said about it because she know most things, and I looked then to the left and the bus that I could easily have been on had I not be walking with Vera I could of easily have been on that bus to Barking station cause it was only one penny you know in those days, you could ride on the bus 240 times for a pound which wasn’t bad was it?</p>
<p><em>No it wasn’t was it </em></p>
<p>Anyway the bus that I could have been on was lying on its side blazing from head to foot they’d strafed the bus, and within I suppose ten minutes the whole thing was over. The plane had gone, the guns stopped, we got up, dusted ourselves down and went on to Barking station, and whet to work, the pair of us. It never occurred to us that, you know we ought to have gone home or anything like that. And I said to Vera, “Vera what were those holes?” She said, “What holes?” I said, “You know, when we were lying on the ground”. She said, “Those holes you dummy were tracer bullet holes, we were being shot at”. I said, “Good job they didn’t hit us”. So we went to work.</p>
<p><em>How old were you then Mary? </em></p>
<p>I was fourteen.</p>
<p><em>Fourteen</em></p>
<p>We were both fourteen, fourteen and a half actually, but fourteen. So we got were I work, I worked a newspaper office, I was only the run about but I was in a newspaper office and Vera was a little up market, she as a training college for what we would call computers now, but they called them comptometers in those days. So when I got to work of course I'm telling somebody at the work what had happened and she said, “Well don’t you think you ought to phone your mother to tell her that you’re alright”. So I said, “Well not really, she wouldn’t know, I’ll tell her when I get home”. She said, “You had better get on that phone and tell your mother she’ll probably be having hysterics knowing whats happened and you were on your way here”. So I phoned mum I said,” Mum”, she said, “Oh it’s been terrible here”, she said, “There’s been bombs dropping”. I said, “Where?” So she told me on the corner here, and said those two little girls are dead, and I realised then I’d been living in a dream for that last hour or so thinking oh well you know it was just a little bit of German coming over. So she said, “Its not one plane, its six have been”. And she said, “There’ people being killed all over the town”. So she said, “You’d better come home”. So I then said I must go and tell Vera, so I went to Vera’s college which was in the centre of London. I was at Fleet Street end and she was up somewhere past the law courts, and so I asked if I could she her and she was in a class, so I said, “Vera I think we ought to go home. I've been sent home because there has been some bombs dropped in our roads and I think you better come with me”. So now she had been so calm when we laying on the ground, so calm pushing me down and telling me you know to be careful and that sort of thing but when she realised that the house directly behind hers had been bombed and the person was killed in the house, she went to pieces, the shock you see had hit her. So I brought her home this time, left her with her mum who was also badly shocked. All the windows had gone from the house and everything else you see and then I came home here and my mother of course couldn’t believe that I could be so calm about it, and I said “I wasn’t being calm I was just stupid you know but it was a dreadful raid and it happened so quickly. All the six planes got hit, they were all captured, I don’t think the men were killed I think they came down by parachutes or something but, but it was a dreadful experience and that was Barking park. And now if I'm on the bus, I don’t walk that way I can assure you anymore to Barking station and I look at those shrubs and of course they full grow now they’re trees, and I think I cant believe it happened but it did, it was the twelfth of March 1943.</p>
<p><em>Were you living this side of Barking by then Mary </em></p>
<p>It was almost opposite, well it was past Fanshawe Avenue, no from here before you get to Fanshaw Avenue, you know where the park keepers house</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Well I don’t think it is a park keepers house now is it?</p>
<p><em>No its no</em></p>
<p>Well anyway you know there’s a house facing Longbridge Road and there’s the big gates, and then there’s the long avenue isn’t there that goes down to the lake and then there’s an avenue at right angles, well we were about there, and as they say, they had, the German planes were, they knew that the anti aircraft battery was there, they were deliberately shooting for that, and that’s why they hit the bus because it was about opposite where the troops would have been, but they didn’t hit the guns at all, I don’t think the guns could have done anything for them because the plane was too low you see.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
<p>Because the guns were very big guns really for shooting right into the air, but this plane was hardly roof top height and I think there were about ten, twenty people in Ilford were killed that morning and it was all over in ten minutes.</p>
<p><em>Yes, so quick.</em></p>
<p>So as I say that's, oh but then, that isn’t the end of that particular story, the war ended in nineteen forty five, the men came home from the war. Most of them had got families, they needed homes, there was a terrible, with the bombing, terrible shortage of home. People were living in, with relatives, sleeping on the floor, sleeping in air raid shelters, one thing and another, and a few young men who’d been home from the army, not necessarily demobbed but home on leave. They said, “Barking Park, all those billets for the soldiers”, the soldiers had gone by then you see, the guns had been dismantled and taken away. But they still got barbed wire round the place and you know keep out and army commands and that sort of thing. So these young men fresh from the army, they said, “Look at those barracks, standing empty, they’ve got all mod cons”. They asked the Council. The Council said, “It’s nothing to do with us it’s War Office”. They asked the War Office, “Nothing to do with us it’s Barking Council”. So the men said, “It’s something to do with us”. So they got together and they broke down the walls of the barbed wire, they forced the gates, they took over the barracks, they moved in as squatters. You’d have thought the war had started again. Barking Council, the War Office, the ARP, all the people, people that lived there said, “We don’t want squatters, we want those things cleared away”. And these men said, “Look we’ve been fighting for our country for five, six years, we are homeless, we are moving in”. And there was a real stand off for about two years but they got their way. They worked on them themselves, they didn’t get any help from the Government or from the Council, and the Council were trying to get them out all the time. So the young men who had got families said, “You build us houses and then we’ll get out but not until you build us houses.</p>
<p><em>And how long were they there for Mary?</em></p>
<p>Well it must have been at least two years.</p>
<p><em>Really.</em></p>
<p>At least two years possibly more because then they built, there was so much damage you see round about barking and East Ham and so on, they built a lot of prefabs.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
<p>In different areas which went up very quickly, they said they were only going to be up there for about five years but they stayed about twenty [laugh]. And they were alright.</p>
<p><em>They were, they were.</em></p>
<p>But we had neighbours across the road and her son was one of those squatters and I went to see how comfortable, I didn’t see their, I didn’t go into the barracks but he got one of these prefabs, and he and his family, and I went to the prefab and they were lovely, lovely little places.</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes they were.</em></p>
<p>It had two bedrooms and a living room and a kitchen and a bathroom, a little garden all the way round, and they were really very nice.</p>
<p><em>Yes they were and they stood the test of time didn’t they.</em></p>
<p>But of course they have all gone now. Yes absolutely. So as I say after that Barking Park well I didn’t go in very much then because by that time I was grown up and had other things to do and so on. The war was over and people were back and of course another thing you see they dug up most of the flower beds to grow vegetables and that sort of thing so they had all that to reinstate.</p>
<p><em>Who grew the vegetables then?</em></p>
<p>Well the allotments you see.</p>
<p><em>Oh they were turned into allotments.</em></p>
<p>They have still got the allotments there, oh yeast the South Park Drive end of the park you see there but as I say the other excitement of course was when they had the fair, twice a year it came there. That was another thing my mother said, “You are not going to that fair, all those people there”. I said, “Mum there not likely to steal me are they? I’m not likely to be taken away by the gypsies”. So she said, “No”...</p>
<p><em>I was never allowed to go to fairs [laugh].</em></p>
<p>“And make sure you lock the door when you come in because they are all thieves and vagabonds”. The thieves and vagabonds were not the people who run the side shows they were the visitors. We did have, at one time we did have a lot of housebreaking went on. But as I say it wasn’t the people who worked on the fair it was the people that went to the fair, lost all their money on the side shows and then came and robbed people’s houses you see. But we did, but I don’t know that it happens today it’s not like the same, I don’t know, I’ve never heard of anybody.</p>
<p><em>How often would the fair, you said they were twice a year the fairs?</em></p>
<p>It use to be once a year but I think it’s twice now. It use to be in September, end of August beginning of September when they had the big fair, they had a carnival procession, they had a Barking carnival queen and they had the procession all the way down Longbridge Road and they had the crowning of the queen and all the rest of it. We always went to that you see, but I don’t think they have it now, I’ve not heard for a few years that they have a carnival queen anymore but they still have the fair. I t goes twice a year I think now.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember the tea rooms that were there?</em></p>
<p>Oh they were lovely, it was a wooden building like a big xxxx, it had a veranda around it, and I think they served food but mostly it was ice cream and cake and sweets, that sort of thing, but I think they did actually do catering as well. Very nice toilets, and as I say they really did go to a lot of trouble to make people comfortable. The boats and...</p>
<p><em>Did you ever go on the boats?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, yes, I only ever went, now that doesn’t speak highly of my brother, the one who was a year older than me, I suppose I would be about nine and he would be ten, and my mother’s sister came down from Oldham in Lancashire and she was a typical, well she was my aunt but I thought she was a very old lady but she obviously wasn’t, and my grandmother still lived with us you see, here in this very house, as I say all this has happened since we were living in this house. All these stories that I’m telling you happened around this particular house. So my grandmother...</p>
<p><em>So your parents lived here?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, yes, I’ve been here ever since, nearly eighty years I’ve lived in this house and when it was first built you see my father built it, it was one of the houses he built. Started at Longbridge Road and worked through and built right up to Goodmayes Lane and then built another estate on the other side of Ilford you see.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
<p>And so my aunt came down, my mother’s sister, I don’t think she had been to London ever, my mother had never been until we had to come down here. So she was staying with us here, so grandma and aunt Emily took us to the park, and the dog, not my eldest brother he was at school or he might have been working by that time. Anyway we went and auntie or grandma provided the few pennies so we could go on the boats, this is the children’s lake, that's the South Park Drive end, it was a children’s, much shallower water you see, and they had paddle boats and they had rowing boats but they were child size. So I’m in the paddle boat, my brother George was in a rowing boat, and we were shuffling backwards and forwards by the edge of the water and auntie and grandma were sitting on the seat watching us. Well my brother drew his boat into the small wall; the jetty for getting on and off was the other end, South Park Drive end, so my brother calls out, “Auntie let me row you around the lake”. So my aunt said to him, “Eh Georgie I can’t get in that little boat, it’s not for ladies”. “Oh that's no trouble”, he said, “Come on get in and I’ll take you around, I’ll row you around, all around you’ll love it”. So my aunt said, “Eh no I don’t think so, I don’t think that boats big enough for me”. So he said, “Oh grandma often come in don’t you grandma”. I don’t know what grandma said but she certainly did not go in that boat ever. Then he said to me, “Mary you tell auntie to get in the boat, not yours, she can’t get in yours but tell her to get in my boat and we’ll all go round the lake”. Well I joined in, I said, “Come on auntie, come on”. She was reluctant, very reluctant, but eventually with the two of us she got in this boat. Well she was about twelve stone quite that, he was about five, four stone; he was smaller than I was. Well the boat practically capsized, it couldn’t move, it didn’t move, he was putting his oars in and they didn’t touch the water because the boat was at such an angle. So my aunt’s sitting back, the number of the boat was behind her you see, she’s sitting back and she said, “Oh it’s nice isn’t it, oh it’s lovely, I didn’t think I could get in”, she said. Grandma’s still sitting on the seat looking nervous and I’m laughing and giggling and turning the handles you see on my paddle boat and I was aware that the man who was in charge of the boats was shouting and he’s calling out “Number fifty six”, or whatever, I can’t remember what the number was but he was calling out a number and he’s shouting out and aunt Emily, who wasn’t really a simpleton but she came across that day as being very simple, she said, “Eh Georgie whats that man shouting for like that?” “Oh he’s calling in one of the boats, that's alright auntie nothing to do with us”, he said. She said, “He’s making a lot of noise, he sounds very angry”. So George is trying to row this boat but he can’t get the oars in the water, so we are more or less by the side of the path you see. Well this man put on his waders and he came walking through the water, and when he got to us he gave my poor aunt such a telling off. “You stupid woman”. “Eh but my little, my nephew said it’s quite safe”. “Safe, you’re ruining the boat, your capsizing, get out immediately”, he said. So he pulls the rope right up to the edge and he makes her get out. Well of course we children were rolling out trying not to be seen laughing because we thought he was so angry he would probably push us in the water or something. And grandma was her shaking her head as if to say, “I don’t know who these people are, I don’t want anything to do them”. And so of course we all came home you see and mum gave us both a ticking off, she gave my aunt a ticking off for being silly enough to take notice of him, she gave grandma a ticking off for letting us do it, poor grandma had no choice, she just sat there all the time, and my aunt carried that story for the rest of her life. She use to come down once a year and she said, “If either of you children think I’m going into Barking Park with you lot”, and the dog was there too. So that's why I can remember a lot about Barking Park.</p>
<p><em>Did your mum settle into Barking?</em></p>
<p>She loved it.</p>
<p><em>She did.</em></p>
<p>Now that was very strange because as I say she lived in Oldham, Lancashire, she was born there, she lived there until she was forty, forty one, something like that. Then we went to Cumbria, Penrith, and she loved it there. She was in the country and people were very friendly, we only lived in a very old cottage but the people were very friendly, my mother was a very friendly person and with her soft accent, her Lancashire accent, people, your much too young to remember this lady but she was called Gracie Fields...</p>
<p><em>Oh I do remember Gracie Fields.</em></p>
<p>She was on television, no not television, there was no such thing as television, on the films. And my mother spoke just like her, so as soon as my mother opened her mouth people would say, “Gracie Fields”, and so on. So you know she was, she’d laugh you see so she was accepted. Well when dad’s firm bought this land in Barking and she told people, her relatives and friends and so on, that we were going to London, she called it London, everybody called it London but it was barking, and they said, “In London, you won’t like London”. They had never been. “Oh you won’t like London, they are horrible people, oh no, no, you won’t like it at all, oh don’t go”. She said, “I’ve got to go Harry’s jobs there”. And of course in those days the depression was on, the big depression, we think it’s bad now but believe me it was a lot worse then. So she said, “We’ve got to go it’s our living”. “Oh you won’t like it, oh they’re awful, they’re standoffish, they won’t talk to you, you’ll be very unhappy”. All her neighbours and her friends up there. So she said, “Well I can’t help it, I’ve got to go where Harry’s work is, and he won’t go without me and we have got to have the job and the children”. So she was really scared, and as I say she brought me down on the train from Cumbria, just the two of us, I was only three.</p>
<p><em>And even to do that must have been quite frightening for her.</em></p>
<p>It was, it was tremendous for her, she had never been anywhere like that before. They went to Blackpool for holidays you see which was quite close and she knew everybody and they all spoke the same, and Blackpool it was like we would go to Southend.</p>
<p><em>Yes to make that journey on her own with a small child.</em></p>
<p>And she had had to pack up the furniture, the furniture was going down in a van and she had had all that to do. When she got there, we didn’t know what sort of a house we had got, when she got there, there was this little tiny house, two bedrooms, and I don’t know whether the furniture had arrived before we got there I can’t remember, but we had to sleep there, whether we had beds that first night I don’t remember, but we had to live there. And all dad did was to walk down the garden onto the building site you see, that's why, we didn’t buy the house the man who owned the land bought the house for us to live in just because it was convenient you see to the building site. So all dad did was to get out of bed, have his breakfast, walk down the garden onto the building site and he was there all day, well he would come home for some meals but poor mum was stuck there with three children and an old lady.</p>
<p><em>Not knowing anyone, not knowing the area.</em></p>
<p>A completely strange area, told it was a dreadful place...</p>
<p><em>Even before she’d left Oldham.</em></p>
<p>But you know June within a week she knew all her neighbours, she knew the shops, we had a corner shop and a real open all hours this corner shop, Mrs Mitchell run that, I remember it to this day, and I could go to it even though I was only three, it was just on the corner you see, not much traffic about, and my mother would say to me “Go to Mrs Mitchell’s and get me...”, whatever, and I’d trot off, I don’t think we had the dog then, I’d trot off with my pushchair, a doll’s pram or something, and I always, apparently I always bought back what I was suppose to. She would give me the money and she’d say, only three, “Now bring back the change”.</p>
<p><em>It seems incredible now doesn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Well that’s right.</p>
<p><em>A different world.</em></p>
<p>And I was so proud, the fact you know that she trusted me and I went and got half a pound of tea or whatever it was you see. And mum would say, “Now where’s my change”, [laugh]. “And what are you eating?” And I’d say, “Mrs Mitchell gave it to me”, [laugh]. So as I say, but within a week she had settled and she knew everybody and she said, “I don’t know whats the matter with them but they have never been”.</p>
<p><em>Yes we all have preconceived ideas.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t use the word prejudice but that’s what it was, people say these things, so we were there...</p>
<p><em>Do you remember moving into this house Mary?</em></p>
<p>Well we were there for nearly two years, oh you might not want to hear this, I started, when we first went there I told you I was three, my brother was, three and a bit, my brother was four and a bit, there was only fifteen months between us. We were living in this little house, I suppose was difficult as a three year old can be, perhaps a bit more because of the unsettling, one thing and another. I don’t know what I had done that particular day but I had done something awful, I don’t know, but anyway there was a girl next door and she was eight and she took me under her wing, and she came home from school, the school was only two doors away, still there. Edna came home from school and I was in disgrace for something or other, she wanted to play with me and mum said, “No she’s been naughty”, and one thing and another, I don’t know what mum said to her but the upshot of it was that Edna washed my face, combed my hair, put me on a clean dress, I mean eight years old they love to do things like that, put me on a clean dress, or put me on a dress, I don’t know what it was, and took me to school. Apparently my mother had said, “Oh get her out of my sight”, she really had had enough of me. Take her to school, get rid of her, I don’t want to see her again”, something to that effect you see. So Edna took me to school, only next door but one. Now I remember it ever so well, I wasn’t happy about this woman, so we went into this school, I’d never seen a school before and Edna spoke to this lady and the lady said to me, “What’s your name?” So I told her, she said, “Where do you live?” So I told her, so she said, “How old are you?” So Edna said, “She’s five Miss”, well I was a big kid. So I said, “I’m not, I’m three and a half and I’m only here because my mum said she’ll kill me”. So this woman, she was the headmistress, I didn’t know it at the time, she said to Edna, “Edna is this true?” Well Edna couldn’t deny it you see. “Well take this child home and tell her mother to look after her”. So I was expelled.</p>
<p><em>Before you even started [laugh].</em></p>
<p>So I probably got a wallop when I got home, probably Edna got one too [laugh]. That was, I don’t know what time of the year that was when we went down, it was in the summer time and I was three in the July, and this was probably in the school holiday’s time and by the time I was five we were still there. I had my fifth birthday in July and do you know my mother sent me to school the next day, she couldn’t get rid of me soon enough. She sent me the day after I was five and I didn’t like it very much and I suppose I remember that first time you see when I had been expelled but I had one week at that school and then the holidays came, July holidays came, and we moved here in the August. So I started at South Park School in the August you see. I didn’t get expelled from there, I nearly did but...</p>
<p><em>To the relief of your mother [laugh]</em></p>
<p>I run away actually, I run away from there. Well I run home actually, I did go back the next day but I let myself home, nobody missed me, no, nobody bothered.</p>
<p><em>It was a different world wasn’t it.</em></p>
<p>Probably glad to see the back of me, I don’t know. I let myself home, I’d had enough, I just walked home. Those days you see, nowadays everywhere all the school gates are locked because of the intruders. Isn’t it terrible to think that children have to be locked in and they won’t let the children home unless the parents are there. We use to wander home backwards and forwards ourselves, there was no restriction on us at all. Yes I let myself, I bought myself home, mum saw me in the kitchen, she said, “What are you doing home this time of the day?” I said, “The teacher said I’ve got dirty hands and that I’d got to go and wash”. So mum said “You didn’t have to come home to wash”. So I said, “Well that’s where I wash”. So mum said, “Well you can’t go back today, you can’t go back now”. So the next day I thought am I going to get into trouble because I went home without permission but nobody missed me so nobody said a word.</p>
<p><em>So you were alright [laugh]</em></p>
<p>So I got away with that one.</p>
<p><em>Mary do you remember we were told that they had dances in the park, they would have a band in the summer?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes</p>
<p><em>Do you remember?</em></p>
<p>Oh I never went to anything like that but they did oh yes, oh yes that’s what I say they had all of this. Everything was going on in the park</p>
<p><em>Lots of activities wasn’t there?</em></p>
<p>Yes there was but going back to when we actually moved in here, we moved in here the August bank holiday weekend and on the Sunday my father said he would take us three children down to Water Lane to the school. The school was closed, it was a Sunday but it was the school holidays anyway you see but he said I’ll take you down and show you where the school will be when you go to school next term. All three of us went to the, we were due to start at the same there was the infants, juniors and seniors then at South Park School so mum was doing the dinner and Dad took us down with the dog, down to South Park to have a look, we didn’t go into the school it was all locked up but we saw when the school was so on the way back we called in at South Park, do you know South Park?</p>
<p><em>No I don’t</em></p>
<p>Well it’s about 10 minutes, less than 10 minutes walk from here so we went into South Park and my two brothers had a ball and they were playing with the ball. So we were with dad walking through the park and the park keeper came on his bicycle and he shouted at the two boys “stop that” and my father said “what’s the matter” and he said “they’re playing ball” so my father said “well it’s a park” “you can’t play ball on a Sunday” so my father said “what on earth are you talking about, it’s a park they’re playing ball they’re doing no harm” so he said “you can’t play ball in the park on a Sunday, I’m telling you, so stop it” so my father said “I’ve never heard such nonsense, you can do anything in Barking Park” so this park keeper said “Barking Park? Huh this isn’t Barking this is Ilford and you don’t play ball on Sundays in Ilford” so my father said “you can play ball, you can play cricket, you can swim, you can play tennis in Barking” “that’s Barking” he said “that’s not Ilford” so that was the difference.</p>
<p><em>Looked down upon</em></p>
<p>And Barking you could, there was everything going on in Barking Park as you say, bands, brass bands. There was the big bandstand and they had concerts there, they had, as I say it was a community?</p>
<p><em>Were they free, the concerts were they free?</em></p>
<p>I don’t think, I think sometimes there was a collection, I don’t think you paid no. But if you wanted to sit down they had chairs around the bandstand and people used to wander about, we took it for granted you see it was lovely, very well looked after.</p>
<p><em>I was going to ask you about the gardens</em></p>
<p>Oh the gardens were beautiful; we had to be very careful. We weren’t allowed the play around there no. the gardens were beautifully kept but that was away from the playing area you see, the playing area was mostly level with Longbridge Road. The flower beds were in the long path running up to the boat house and also level with the lake they had these by the war memorial and so on. They had these beds with you know styled red white and blue all of that sort of thing</p>
<p><em>Oh yes yes</em></p>
<p>But it was very well looked after, it was a feature and we were very grateful to have it. We took it for granted I know but so different to coming to South Park where I say you were under so [clock chimes] that’s the clock. You were under such restriction you see, Ilford was snobby. When we moved, that was another thing, the 18 months we were in Barking when mum said “we’re on the move again” and they said “where you going this time” and she told them we were coming here and they said “that’s Ilford” “oh” she said “you won’t like it in Ilford, you won’t like it” she said “oh they’re snobby in Ilford it’s all pride piano and poverty in Ilford, the three Ps” [laughs] they all call Ilford the three Ps.</p>
<p><em>The three Ps</em></p>
<p>Pride, Piano and Poverty. And she said “lace curtains, got no furniture” she said “no furniture in their front room so they put up lace curtains so you can’t see it” how they knew all of these things I don’t know but you know they were right because when these houses were first built my father, as I said, built them and he was very proud of them and they sold them and actually a lot of them were sold in this house because my father working for the firm knowing the ins and outs of it he was the company secretary as well, I don’t think he got paid for being the secretary but he was, his name was on the deeds you see as the company secretary. People used to come and sign up for their houses here in the evening because they couldn’t take time off work in those days they were very restricted job wise so knowing that we lived on the estate there were houses in the next road and that sort of thing they would come, I expect my father would tell them that “if you can’t come at weekends to sign up come to my house at a certain time and you can do it there” and they often signed up in our dining room, in this very room on our table so that they didn’t lose the time off work you see, so people moved in. well they were on a very short budget, a very very tight budget, nearly all of them a lot of them were young married couples, they could just about raise the money for a deposit and they had a mortgage but the mortgage was the same part of their income as it is now really. If you earned, then people were paid weekly, if you earn less in a week than your monthly payment to the building society you can’t afford it so if your building society it was about a pound a week for the mortgage well if they earned less than three pounds a week they were going to be in trouble so they had to earn perhaps four pounds a week and their mortgage was three / four pounds a month.</p>
<p><em>Would they have had to have put a large deposit down?</em></p>
<p>Not a lot no, some got in for about twenty five pounds you see if you could afford more it made it easier for your mortgage but I think twenty / twenty five pounds was a lot of money, it was a lot of money then and they didn’t take any money that the wife earned into consideration if she worked they ignored that so it’s a lot different to how it is now. But they only gave you one month grace, if you missed your mortgage payment one month you got a notice of quit and you were out. So people used to be told to be very careful because you could lose it if you lose your job or you buy something so of course they didn’t buy furniture for their front room but they put up lace curtains so that nobody saw that the room was empty.</p>
<p><em>Did you mother like the house when she came here?</em></p>
<p><em>Did you mother like the house when she came here?</em></p>
<p>Yes she did, as I say we didn’t intend to stay had it not been for the war the firm would have built in different areas but the war came and the other estate that dad built, I don’t know if you know ilford at all going towards Woodford, off the Woodford avenue he built and estate there, bigger houses up market as they say now. They were four or five bed houses there well, he could do that with travelling because it’s only three or four miles but after that estate they were going to build out at Warley, the war came and government commandeered the land at Warley and built and airfield on it so we never moved.</p>
<p><em>I bet your mother was relieved wasn’t she?</em></p>
<p>Well by that time the war of course had claimed my eldest brothers life and things were never quite the same after that and my brother had laid out the garden, my eldest brother had laid out the garden and mum looked upon that as being sacred so she was here and died here and dad was the same.</p>
<p><em>I can understand that</em></p>
<p>And I’m still here, talking your head off [laughs]</p>
<p>I’m sure you’d like a cup of tea though wouldn’t you, I’ve laid out a tray just in case.</p>
<p>[TAPE PAUSED]</p>
<p><em>What I wanted to ask you was about the park keepers, do you have recollections of the park keepers and their uniforms, were they smart?</em></p>
<p>They were all in uniform yes and bicycles. They all had bicycles, they were in uniform but it wasn’t particularly smart but we knew they and of course the fact that they were on bicycles because we weren’t allowed to drive bicycles around the park. They could but we couldn’t. but they were never in vans, they are now aren’t they, with dogs some times.</p>
<p><em>Were they strict?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, very. We were scared of them, we really were. The parky we used to call them “careful parky’s here” but we really did mind our p’s and q’s with the park keepers. Both at South Park and at Barking.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember the lodge house?</em></p>
<p>The lodge house? Oh yes that was very smart wasn’t it?</p>
<p><em>It was yes</em></p>
<p>In South Park, I think, it got bombed. Yes it got a direct hit during the day and the park keeper’s wife was killed, yes it was a direct hit. Every time I walk through, I don’t walk through very often now, but I see the site where it was its all bushes now and they built another one on the other side of the park but I always remember that day when I saw it in total ruins.</p>
<p><em>You mentioned the war memorial, is that in Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>In which?</p>
<p><em>The war memorial, is that in barking park?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes there is one, there’s not one in ilford, in South Park, but in Barking. In Ilford there’s one in the little park by King George hospital that’s still there but in Barking Park it’s facing Longbridge road, I don’t know what condition it’s in now and that long avenue that runs level with parallel with Longbridge Road</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>So about the middle…yeah</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And that</p>
<p><em>Did they have a service there on…?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, yes</p>
<p><em>On Remembrance Day?</em></p>
<p>Yes there was always a service there for…I don’t know whether there still is but always a service for…memorial on Armistice Day</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And we were taken to it with my father, was an army man</p>
<p><em>Ah right</em></p>
<p>And he made sure that we, we went</p>
<p><em>You’d go</em></p>
<p>And we stood to attention and behaved ourselves</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>There was no messing around for that no and the scouts and all the others organisations, they all…erm paraded and so on it was…</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>It was all done very nicely</p>
<p><em>Yes and what about the railway, did you ever go on the railway?</em></p>
<p>No I don’t remember it when I was a child, I don’t think it was there, I’ve taken lots of children onto it</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Since I’ve grown up</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But I don’t think it was there before the war, no</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>I’m sure it wasn’t no</p>
<p><em>Probably built after the war</em></p>
<p>No I’m sure had it been there we would have known</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But erm, but I do remember it being there and taking erm friends children to see it, but I never went on it myself</p>
<p><em>You…oh you never actually…</em></p>
<p>I’m sure I would have done had it been in my generation</p>
<p><em>Yes, what about wildlife do you remember like…?</em></p>
<p>Well squirrels, a lot of squirrels</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>We didn’t take a lot of amount of notice [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Though we didn’t have the Canada geese, now they are messy things aren’t they? There were no Canada geese</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>When I was a child, no I don’t think they come into England at all</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>They’ve been imported since the war</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>There were certainly no Canada geese</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And now they’re everywhere aren’t they?</p>
<p><em>Yes they are</em></p>
<p>But there were ducks, lots of ducks on the pond</p>
<p><em>Did you feed the ducks?</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, yes that was a great treat yes and erm there was big ducks and little ducks and more hens and…so on</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And erm we never took nests or anything like that but erm we certainly didn’t see any other…and the squirrels, they were always around</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And as I say we usually as children we nearly always had our dog with us, so there was lots of…he would chase them</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Mind you we were suppose to keep him on a lead, but he would chase anything that was chasuble and erm so but erm we didn’t study erm wildlife in the park, I mean some people did, you know people…I’ve seen people you know writing in a notebook when they’d seen certain things but we didn’t, we just played</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>It was just some…</p>
<p><em>What games did you play in the park did you…?</em></p>
<p>Chasing I think [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Just running round</em></p>
<p>Yes that’s right, I was never, I was never sport minded but my eldest brother belonged to the tennis club there</p>
<p><em>Oh of course they had tennis courts there didn’t they?</em></p>
<p>Yes oh yes</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They play and erm I used to sometimes go and watch him play, I never played myself I don’t…I still don’t know the rules actually but he was very keen and erm</p>
<p><em>Did you have to pay for that or…?</em></p>
<p>Oh I think so</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>I don’t think it was very much but I’m sure they had to pay</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>They had to book</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And I’m sure if they booked they’d have to pay something, but it was probably only coppers</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But erm they had to book mmh</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And they had to play properly…they wore their whites</p>
<p><em>Oh really</em></p>
<p>Oh yes [bell ringing] it would have been erm considered right to go in anything</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Other then white flannels</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And erm jumper or something like that</p>
<p><em>Yes they look very smart there</em></p>
<p>Oh yes they did</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They took pride in it</p>
<p><em>Yes, was there a tennis club there?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know I don’t remember</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>I just wondered</em></p>
<p>No I don’t remember, I do remember...mum being, well I suppose I’m getting a bit ten or eleven, something like that, don’t go in the toilets on your own there might e somebody in there you know not nice</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>XXXX the word sex attack would never...</p>
<p><em>No that was never mentioned</em></p>
<p>...interfere with you</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>You know that sort of thing, we were warned and there were always people...I say always, we were always warned there might be people, men</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>That would, you know not very nice people</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes</em></p>
<p>But the words were never used</p>
<p><em>No, no</em></p>
<p>The word sex never ever came into my generation</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>But erm it was always this interfere; don’t let anyone interfere with you</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Now remember don’t get talking to people cos they might interfere</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And I don’t know they meant really</p>
<p><em>No [Laughs] we were very naive weren’t we</em></p>
<p>Well we were yes, just as well I think really</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes</em></p>
<p>Children learn too much about that too soon don’t they?</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes they do</em></p>
<p>Mmh</p>
<p><em>What about...somebody mentioned a life size chess set that adults could play, but only the adults...wonder if you...</em></p>
<p>No I don’t remember that at all</p>
<p><em>No XXXX</em></p>
<p>No, no that’s something...I think after my generation, but...</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I don’t remember that at all</p>
<p><em>And what would you like to see happen...erm to the park, like when...the renovation, what would you like?</em></p>
<p>Well it would be nice if, if there was like a club room or the elderly people</p>
<p><em>Yes definitely</em></p>
<p>Erm, I mean if the tea room is there they would you that</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But erm like a sort of day centre erm because there are a lot of elderly people living alone, they don’t want it for nothing</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>But somewhere where they can be sit and warm I mean you don’t always want to sit out in the cold</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>On a park bench, but if there was like a club room or something like that, that where they could erm you know...mix</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And have a scrabble or something like that</p>
<p><em>I think that’s an excellent idea Mary</em></p>
<p>I think it would be, it would be</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Very much appreciated and erm not too far into the park because if you’re not walking very well you don’t to have to walk the whole length of the Long Avenue, if it was somewhere sort of nearer to Longbridge road</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Where they could pop in, when they’ve done a bit of shopping and they’re tired</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They could pop in for an hour or two, it’d be rather nice</p>
<p><em>Yes that would be</em></p>
<p>You know little drop in centre</p>
<p><em>Yes that, that’s an excellent idea Mary it really is</em></p>
<p>Well you think of these things when you yourself are getting older you see</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>I mean when you’re young you never think of that, why do I want to sit in the shed in the park you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah, but...</em></p>
<p>Run about, climb trees</p>
<p><em>They’re going to cater for children</em></p>
<p>Oh we couldn’t climb trees did you know that</p>
<p><em>Oh really</em></p>
<p>Oh no, no oh no</p>
<p><em>Strictly off limits was that?</em></p>
<p>Oh absolutely</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Not allowed to climb trees no</p>
<p><em>Yeah and obviously, what about walking on the grass?</em></p>
<p>I don’t think they minded</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Except round by the flowerbeds</p>
<p><em>Flowers</em></p>
<p>But there was, there was...I never remember being told keep off the grass unless of course we were near the war memorial there, but then we wouldn’t anyway cos we had to be respectful</p>
<p><em>You were brought up not to do that</em></p>
<p>You see you were brought up to...but otherwise they weren’t nearly as...strict as were in South Park they were...it was a bit of a...I think the main park keeper there was a bit of a bully</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And the staff had to...go his way</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Cos he was...they were very strict Barking was much more relaxed</p>
<p><em>More friendly</em></p>
<p>More friendly in every way Mmh</p>
<p><em>Well it’s been lovely talking to you Mary</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] oh I’ve enjoyed June</p>
<p><em>I’ve really enjoyed listening to your...</em></p>
<p>As they say it was a...it was a good time</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>You know there wasn’t...we didn’t have...I think the most pocket money I ever had at that time was a shilling</p>
<p><em>Really</em></p>
<p>A week and...</p>
<p><em>What did you used to spend it on?</em></p>
<p>Well it wasn’t a lot you could spend it on because sweets were rationed</p>
<p><em>Yeah of course the war</em></p>
<p>You see and erm...I can remember saving it up and buying...something silly...I brought a carpet sweeper</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Funny for a child to buy a carpet sweeper wasn’t it?</p>
<p><em>Yes [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But...I was intrigued with, with this wooden carpet sweeper and I brought it at Blake’s corner there was a big shop called Blake’s and it’s where Boots is now</p>
<p><em>Of right yes, yes</em></p>
<p>Exactly where Boots is there, that was called Blake’s corner and erm...I had all this, I think...it was only about a pound, I think it was that way</p>
<p><em>That’s a lot of saving though</em></p>
<p>I had this money all in...Shillings</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And...I was out with my mum and she said to me ‘what are you going to spend your money on?’ and I came home with this carpet sweeper, we had it for years</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I loved doing it you know what I mean; all over the...I wasn’t house proud but it...made a nice noise</p>
<p><em>Yeah [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And I was running up and down the hall with it you know</p>
<p><em>I bet you mum loved that [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And I thought to myself afterwards what a strange thing for a little girl to buy</p>
<p><em>For a little girl to buy</em></p>
<p>I was so proud of it</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>The handle unscrewed, long handle, unscrewed and it had like rubber buffers oh it was, it was good I mean there’d be about thirty pound today</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah not a pound anymore</em></p>
<p>I was so proud of that carpet sweeper [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But as I say sweets, we couldn’t buy because they were on ration</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And erm I don’t know what else I did with my money, we didn’t have a lot but erm</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>But didn’t need a lot really cos mum feed us you see and we didn’t go on buses and so on but erm, but it was</p>
<p><em>But you enjoyed Barking Park</em></p>
<p>Yes well as I say it was so close</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And oddly enough erm...we had no problem about crossing the road...cos you see from here you got to cross South Park Drive</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>To get into the park</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But erm I don’t ever remember</p>
<p><em>Not too much traffic</em></p>
<p>Any restrictions on us</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>But erm no crossings as such but erm there was an amount of traffic then you see</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>Like there is now, but I, I don’t ever remember being told ‘you mustn’t go cos you can’t cross the road’</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Cos we...and we were usually...not on our own you see there was usually several of us</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Went there</p>
<p><em>Little groups</em></p>
<p>Rounded groups but it was safe, never felt unsafe, I never ever felt unsafe in the park...which I think is good</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Cos it’s you know a nice feeling...if anything had upset you, you’d avoid going again</p>
<p><em>That’s right, that’s right</em></p>
<p>But erm no as I say erm...when I went, I went to stay with friends in Canada a couple of times and they couldn't get over...they came over here to...they couldn't get over the fact that we had railings round our parks</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>They don’t there</p>
<p><em>No and they always have erm fence round their gardens do they?</em></p>
<p>The parts of Canada I was in western Canada</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>All the parks were...you just walked off the pavement</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Into the...but somehow when I came back I thought oh I’m glad we’ve got railings</p>
<p><em>Yeah it would seem strange if we didn’t have yeah</em></p>
<p>Mmh and when, when the war...they took the railings down you see...put wooden slates or something</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>Because they took the railings for the war effort</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>And erm we couldn't wait for they put them back again, we liked the railings</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes we do don’t we? [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes we do yes fences and railings</p>
<p><em>Yes it would seem very strange</em></p>
<p>Whereas in Canada and America they think we’re odd don’t they</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They don’t have railings and front paths or</p>
<p><em>That’s right</em></p>
<p>Well they don’t have front erm gates do they</p>
<p><em>No, no they don’t</em></p>
<p>Just drive straight in</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But we didn’t like that, no when it was like that in the war, we couldn't wait to have thins back</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>With the railing round</p>
<p><em>You’ve got some lovely memories Mary</em></p>
<p>Well as they say</p>
<p><em>Of the park</em></p>
<p>It’s only when you’re asked about them, that you remember it you see</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>We took it so much for granted</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>I think that’s what it was; you take life so much for granted</p>
<p><em>And you think it’s always going to be there don’t you?</em></p>
<p>But, but children miss so much today, I think</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>It’s sad really that children aren’t allowed to do those sort of things, I mean no way would my mother have allowed us to go in as the conditions as they are today</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>You know</p>
<p><em>No you’d be frightened</em></p>
<p>If we begged and prayed, she would say no and I can’t go with you cos I’m too busy</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Or mother’s at work you see</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>You don’t go and play in the park</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>And we knew why, I mean now a days children know why</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>We didn’t</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Our mum would say ‘no, don’t go talking to anyone they might interfere with...’</p>
<p><em>Yes stay out of the XXXX [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>We had no idea, we had no...I mean, not the slightest idea what she meant</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>But we knew we mustn’t do it</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>But now a days they know thy know all the facts</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Too well don’t they?</p>
<p><em>Yes it’s sad</em></p>
<p>Mmh</p>
<p><em>Childhood is very short now a days isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yes that’s right yes it’s very sad that children are only too aware of what happens</p>
<p><em>What’s going on</em></p>
<p>And erm it’s sickening</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But I think that’s an excellent idea of yours about how some...</p>
<p><em>Well as I say</em></p>
<p>A drop in centre for people</p>
<p>But there’s something only somebody like myself would even think about because you, you think to yourself well I do go into Barking for shopping and if I meet somebody, you don’t always go in a tea shop</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>Erm but...erm walk through the park and have a sit down and a cup of tea and a chat with somebody</p>
<p><em>Because the park is for all ages</em></p>
<p>Well that’s right yes</p>
<p><em>And when you look at the park you’ve got the things for the children, you know you’ve got things for young people so you know</em></p>
<p>You wouldn’t dream of going on your own into McDonalds or somewhere like that</p>
<p><em>No, no</em></p>
<p>You see, I mean the only time I would ever do that was say I was waiting...for an appointment or something like that</p>
<p><em>Yeah to fill in the time</em></p>
<p>Fill in the time for half an hour or something like that, but if it was the park, you’d meet somebody</p>
<p><em>Yes and really it’s not about the tea</em></p>
<p>Oh no</p>
<p><em>It’s about the chat isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>It’s meeting people, that’s right yes</p>
<p><em>Having a chat with somebody</em></p>
<p>And a sit down and to feel that you’re, you can meet with friends</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>That’s right like a little, a little...club house or something</p>
<p><em>I think that’s an excellent idea</em></p>
<p>But sadly</p>
<p><em>It’s all about money isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>It’s about money and the vandals, you know there’s always a fear that people would burn it down or</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>You know...scribble all over the walls or</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Urinating it or something</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Make it smelly or something like that, cos that’s what they do</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Isn’t it? Unfortunately</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>It wouldn’t be, I mean in South Park they burned the...they burned the bowls place down I think two or three times</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I don’t think they’ve got one at all now there, it’s been deliberately</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Torched</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And their refreshment room was torched years ago</p>
<p><em>Really?</em></p>
<p>Mmh but erm it’s such a shame</p>
<p><em>Sad yes</em></p>
<p>You get just the odd...two or three</p>
<p><em>Yes spoil it for everyone</em></p>
<p>And they spoil it for everybody don’t they? Mmh</p>
<p><em>Well thank you for talking to me</em></p>
<p>Oh it’s been a pleasure June it really has</p>
<p><em>I’ve really enjoyed it; good I’m glad you enjoyed it</em></p>
<p>Well I...</p>
