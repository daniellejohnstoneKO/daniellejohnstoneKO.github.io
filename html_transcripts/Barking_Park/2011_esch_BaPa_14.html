<p>2011_esch_BaPa_14</p>
<p><em>Ok should be on now</em></p>
<p>I still might miss a few things</p>
<p><em>Ohh[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>The louder you can speak the better</p>
<p><em>Ok, right, erm could I just ask you to say your name please?</em></p>
<p>Yep, I’m John Golding</p>
<p><em>And can I just ask you to say your date of birth for the tape?</em></p>
<p>Yep, 5/12/43 of December ...43</p>
<p><em>Erm, can I ask you what’s like your earliest memory of Barking Park is?</em></p>
<p>Er, I think it must be at the Lido, or Leedo, ha we called it the Lido [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] </em></p>
<p>I think most people called it Lido, yeah, I remember seeing that. Erm and a little paddling pool next to it.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>Well it was outside of the paddling, outside of the Lido. But yeah I remember sitting in the Lido, dunno how old I was ‘bout four or five perhaps six. And er, yeah I was with me mother, she used to take me over there quite a bit. And I remember sort of being in the Lido and bein’ fascinated by the blue, I think it must’ve been a blue tie all sort of round and the blue</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmmm</em></p>
<p>The er, swimming pools and the reflection of the water, you know the blue, and....I think there were fountains there, I think</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know</p>
<p><em>Erm, did you use to go to the Lido a lot? When you was young?</em></p>
<p>Er, probably every six, eight weeks perhaps?</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Erm, we probably went there, in there each time, we went to the park, but it’s frustrating, because I couldn’t do anything in there.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I was too young, and me mum couldn’t swim, so she couldn’t take me in there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>So we just use to sit there and I, yeah I was watching everyone enjoying themselves. I think she liked it just for the atmosphere</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Erm, but it was always frustratin’ that I couldn’t, sort of do anything there.</p>
<p><em>Oh, did you use to go in to the children’s paddling pool as well?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah that was my limit [laughs].</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>Er, yeah I’ve got good and bad memories of that. I’ve only got two memories and they were both quite profound. Erm, the bad one was erm, when some boy or a boy threw a milk bottle in to the paddling pool and I was nearest to it. And I don’t think it was ‘cause I was a xxxx at the time, you know doing a good turn. I tried to pick it out, thought it’d be easy, just get hold of it and put it on the side</p>
<p><em>Mmhmmm</em></p>
<p>But because of the reflection in the water, I think they call it refraction</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Is it?</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm, I think so.</em></p>
<p>And it wasn’t where I thought it was</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And as I put me hand down, I gashed me finger</p>
<p><em>Ohhh</em></p>
<p>But fortunately there was a St John’s Ambulance</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Stall, hut there.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>So me mum took me over to them and I s’ppose they put a bandage or a plaster on it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And xxxx it xxxx me up to the hospital which she did when we got home in Plaistow.</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmmm</em></p>
<p>She took me up st Mary’s hospital and er, I dunno what they did to it but whether they stitched or not. But er, yeah that was a, a bad memory. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And then, there’s probably lots of other times just straight forward paddling in there but, but more humorous one was er, when me mum took me and me cousin over there, xxxx xxxx girl cousin, she was a year younger than me, so she woulda been about seven. And she fell in the paddling pool</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Got her clothes wet, so my mum made me take my pants off</p>
<p><em>Yeah </em></p>
<p>So she could put them on, and, and I, well I had me shorts on so I wasn’t naked</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But I think they were itchy, itchy shorts</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>So er, I, going without me pants with only cheap shorts, but again it wasn’t far, you know it wasn’t for long</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But there erm, yeah they’re my only two memories of the paddling pool</p>
<p><em>Oh, erm during the summer was the lido really packed, when it was in the summer?</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember, I’d imagine it was, but I can’t remember people as much, I just remember the er, I suppose the architecture of it</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know, what-, I didn’t appreciate at the time particularly, I mean I suppose it was art deco but er, I know I just like it, you know, it was bright and clear and clean looking all round you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And the noise, you know lots of excitement and</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Fun you know.</p>
<p><em>Erm, when you was younger erm, did you use to play any sports or anything in the park?</em></p>
<p>Sports?</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I did in the streets</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Didn’t do anything over the park, that I remember and, but yeah it’s always sports when I was a kid. In fact I wrote a song about it [laughs].</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>About playing in the streets, you know called it, the street with no cars</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And, it’s based on a song that’s, well was a hit at that time called a pub with no beer, a humorous song and then years late-, or xxx, you know, two years back from now erm, I just got the idea in me head about how we used to play in the street, no cars and ohh you know that will go to that tune, you know</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>So erm, you know I’ve written that, I’ve brought a copy over if, if you know</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>If you wanna read it, ‘cause it is little bit reminiscent of the late forties, early fifties.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah we erm, had the sort of streets where we lived and erm, there wasn’t alot of traffic</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>And your car would come every now and again and we’d just shout out “car!”, you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And then we’d all stop ‘till the car had gone and</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And carry on till the next one came.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm, erm, do you remember about any park wardens or park rangers in the park?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, erm, er, our nearest place, what we called the little park, but it was actually the church yard, a xxxx st Mary’s church in Plaistow. And yeah we used to play there as it was a only a sort of minute from home and er, there was a park keeper there but I don’t remember him, you know I don’t s’ppose we gave him any trouble</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I can only remember him I think just sort of tidying leaves up and that sort of thing</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>In his little hut.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I think we used to talk to him, but er, erm, another one I remember, erm, I think it was called Lister gardens near Plaistow Station</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>Next to St Mary’s hospital</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>There was a park there that backed on to the erm, well it wasn’t a proper park it was just little erm, play ground area and bit of garden and it backed on to the sewer bank. And I remember you know we were about f- thirteen or forteen I think playing on the swings and larkin’ about ha and the park, I was near the s-cemetery as well on the otherside of the cemetery was er, a on the other side the sewer bank was erm, East London Cemetery</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>So we were larkin’ about</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>On the swings and the park keeper said, there’s hospital there and there’s cemetery over there</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>You know, be careful xxxx stop larkin’ about</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Ohh he’s cheerful int he [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But you know</p>
<p><em>yeah</em></p>
<p>you’re alright</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>That’s the only two erm, memories I’ve got of park keepers</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>We used to go to West Ham Park.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Which is a lot bigger but I don’t remember</p>
<p><em>Mhmmm</em></p>
<p>Park keepers over there</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>At that time</p>
<p><em>Do you remember any in Barking Park at all? </em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>I, erm...</em></p>
<p>No I can only remember activities there you know.</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Erm, do you remember like erm, did you use to go on the boat in Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>Barking Park?</p>
<p><em>Yeah [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yeah, erm, well I suppose that’s an early memory as well from that time. That was a progression you know erm, we used to go on the paddle boat</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I don’t know if people have talked about it xxxx</p>
<p><em>Er, think so yeah</em></p>
<p>About the boat, yeah, I think in America, like on the Mississippi they would call it a stern wheeler</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, but it was a small paddle boat, with the erm, you know the revolving pa-, wheel at the back. And er, yeah just used to sit on there and er, go round, chuggin’ around</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>On end of the lake to the other, you know ro-, round a loop. I remember the islands there. I don’t if they’re still there, they probably are. I can’t see they woulda taken them out</p>
<p><em>Yeah, mhmm</em></p>
<p>But ‘remember the, so if go round you see the islands and the ducks and things on them</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And then I s’ppose the progression from that when I could do it on me own was to go in the little paddle</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Little erm</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Paddle boats</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm </em></p>
<p>with the erm</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em> <em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>You know, two handles and left one rowing right the other way and er,</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Yeah that was down the end and that, down the end and that, down the end of the er...</p>
<p><em>Yeah mmhmm</em></p>
<p>....lake. And then I remember when I was about, again about thirteen, fourteen I was over there with a couple of mates and we had the rowing boat out</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I was doing alright with that and erm, we were over by the bank er, the Loxford Lane side</p>
<p><em>Mhmm </em></p>
<p>Buttsbury Road</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Over that side, erm, and as we were there, there were some kids on the bank, started throwing stones at us</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>And we were helpless you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>We, couldn’t throw any back, we couldn’t do anything</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And we just had to try and row away you know</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>We were getting in a bit of muddle, you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah, mmhmm</em></p>
<p>S’all, you know one rowing one way and one rowing the other way</p>
<p><em>Yeah [laughs]</em></p>
<p>And these stones comin’ at us</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And, it often xxxxx way, you know you go out for a bit quiet fun and there’d be someone out to</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Sort of er, spoil it and er, have a go at you, you know, but er.....yeah, yeah the boats were good.</p>
<p><em>Um, did you ever used to go on the Light Railway?</em></p>
<p>Yeah the little xxxx, model rail or miniature railway</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah I’d go on that, you know my mum would sort see me in to it at one end she’d start walkin’ along</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>And then er, after a little while you know the train would start off and catch up with her and then</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Meet her at the other end, down by the lake.</p>
<p><em>Mhmm, yeah. Um how long would it take on the train to from like one side of the park to the other part?</em></p>
<p>I dunno, erm, probably only about a minute [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Ok [laughs]</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t very far</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember how fast it was, but er, yeah I shouldn’t think it was any more than a minute f-from one end to the other one side to the other.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>From Longbridge Road end to the erm, to the boating hut</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, I remember they had these turn table... well it must have been a turn table at each end but I remember the one at the er, Longbridge Road end.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmmm</em></p>
<p>You know they put the engine on it to turn it round and..</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>...go back the other way</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>But readin’ ‘bout Billy Bragg, yeh, dunno if you’ve heard of him, a singer.</p>
<p><em>Erm, I think I have yeah</em></p>
<p>He was like a popular singer in the seventies erm, well he still recording now I suppose, but er, his protest xxxx punk</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>New wave, erm, and a political activist, but he lived in park road or park avenue</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Which came down to the park.</p>
<p><em>Mhmmm</em></p>
<p>So looking back now I ‘mem-, remember her sitting on a train, sort of looking through the railings as we went along. And seeing a re-, gap in the road there. And I think now “Oh, that’s probably where Billy Bragg lived you know [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] </em></p>
<p>He must have gone over the park, well, yeah I think in his book he said he did.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Um, do you remember if there was like any music events or like a circus’ there?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, erm, no sorry I don’t remember a music events. We had a, or they had a carnival, that’s a regular</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>..every year, at the carnival. Th-, I dunno where it’d start of, but I remember it coming along Longbridge Road.</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>And then in to the park. I can only remember one of them, but the one I remember was probably about 1954,’55 summin’ like that. And erm, they had, I s’ppose they had the floats but I remember a car going along. Like a motorcade</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>And there was a, two film stars sitting in the back of it</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Or sitting up on the, it is an open top,</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>they were sitting on the back of the seat.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And it was erm, Anita Ekberg and Anthony Steel.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And they were, you know stars at that time</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I think they married at one point. But I remember seeing them there</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>I mean it’s just the same as now</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>You get the film stars, or</p>
<p><em>mhmm </em></p>
<p>Sort of pop stars. But I remember them at that time er, you know quite thrilled to see them.</p>
<p><em>Yeah [laughs]</em></p>
<p>And er.... and then, I don’t know if it’s the same occasion, but I remember walking through the park with me mum and we were walking behind the qu-, carnival queen and the princesses</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>For some reason they looked round [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I don’t think xxxxx,</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>but they’d turned around and gave me a smile and a [surprised breathe in ] oooh you know [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yeah, bit of a thrill you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And, no I don’t remember any music, but I do remember they had a fire work display</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Possibly part of the carnival</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Celebrations, and that’s a time of the Teddy Boys</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>You know which, some of them got a bad reputation</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Like, the kids do now. But you know most of them, which are sort of, it’s just a fashion thing but erm</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>you know, same as it was me later.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>But there was, I assume there were Teddy boys, I think you know my memory is that they were, and they were larking about, as the erm fireworks went up, you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>The displays, they were going “Ahhh, wuuuuu”, “Ahhhaaa”</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] Yeah, yeah obviously</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Taking the mickey out of their girlfriends or whatever you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But er, I remember laughing at that you know. I’d think ahhh yer know their alright, they're not all trouble, you know</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] I, I was just wondering what, what are Teddy Boys? Because I-</em></p>
<p>What are Teddy boys?</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, it was a style of dress more than anything.</p>
<p><em>Ok.</em></p>
<p>Erm, it comes from the term, “Edwardian”</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know like King Edward</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Time, is it the early nineteen hundreds</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>or nineteen, I think nineteen ten, fifteen, something like that. I think it was the erm, upper class people who started dressing like it first of all.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>They had the er, tight trousers and drape jackets.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmmm</em></p>
<p>You know, long jackets</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Down almost their knees. And er, velvet collar and velvet on the pocket. Things like that and they’d wear a suede shoes with the crepe souls</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>What they call “brothel creepers” for some reason</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And then working class people, you know this is just what I’ve read.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>What I remember, working class boys took it up, and the girls. You know there were “Teddy Girls.” They’d have similar</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Wear and, a lot of them got in to fights, same as they do now. But I think with most people it was just erm, they liked the style</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And wanted to be fashionable, so they wore the clothes</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>But with some of them, you know they were sort of erm, razor fights</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And bike chains and things like that.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>They’d get in fights with other people. Sometimes it’s a racial thing. In Notting Hill in the late 50’s there were riots there</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>You know fighting</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And, but my memories of them, you know, what not, you know, when I was about eleven or twelve</p>
<p><em>yeah</em></p>
<p>was that they’re alright, you know.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>Yeah I remember I was right near mum at a bus stop, and she saw a coin in the gutter</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And she bent to pick it up and there were some Teddy Boys there and they’d say “Oh, that-, that’s mine, I dropped that” you know “sure get out of it” you know</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I, I saw it</p>
<p><em>yeah</em></p>
<p>and we laughed with them</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>But erm, yeah so, I, again, the, the trouble that you read about in the papers</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Was the minority.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>You know so.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Nothings untoward. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Um, did you used to go to the carnival a lot, in the park? </em></p>
<p>No I don’t remember that</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I can just remember that one occasion</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Sitting there</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I think it was a Anita Ek-, yeah I’m sure it was a Anita Ekberg and Anthony Steel</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But the other thing, I don’t know if other people have talked about it in the park was the erm, donkeys and the ponies.</p>
<p><em>Oh erm..yeah</em></p>
<p>Just showin’ you the photos</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, yeah they used to erm....I don’t remember it. I can under-, it’s only ‘cause I got the photo’s</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Or perhaps I can remember it vaguely because they used to ru-, walk along by erm, parallel with Longbridge Road</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>That just, that bit of park</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>In from the railings</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>But looking again at the photos, I realise there was a string of</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Ponies and donkeys</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>Dunno how many, but there was a string of them.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, so I’m sure that was something I made for first [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>You know, er, I loved horses, and er, me grandfather used to work with them. He used to</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Drive the horse drawn ambulances and horse drawn undertaker</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Coaches and hearses</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>So erm, he was always talkin’ to me about them and, and helpin’ him, used to come round with his horse, and I used to feed that, and er, so imagine when I got to the park that’d be the first</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Either that or the xxxx [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Erm....yeahs, lookin’ at the photo, I think crickey, you know. It was soon after the war, you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm, and lookin’ at me wearin’ the snake belt</p>
<p><em>[laughs] yeah.</em></p>
<p>You know that’s, er, you, there still about are they? Popul-,</p>
<p><em>Erm...</em></p>
<p>..elastic belt</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>With the erm snake</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>You know, as a sort of buckle thing</p>
<p><em>Yeah, um</em></p>
<p>All different colours [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Um, do you remember any of the wild life, in the park?</em></p>
<p>No, no I was reading about that on your website</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know s’bout alot of wildlife there</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But, the only things I can remember are the ducks.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Perhaps there were geese there</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>On the islands but, oh and the little fishes [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And we used to go fishing with our nets and er, you know catching the tiddlers, as we called them, and er, put them in a jar, take ‘em home</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Probably find them dead the next morning but...</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Did you used to go fishing a lot in the lake?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, probably did it each time I went there.</p>
<p><em>Mmhmm</em></p>
<p>I seem to remember buyin’ a net in Longbridge Road, you know, just as we got there,</p>
<p><em>yeah</em></p>
<p>you know buyin’ a net and erm, and .....now’ so long ago now. You know [Laughs] sixty years ago, erm, memories not all that clear.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>No, nothing, talkin’ about Longbridge Road and the shops there. I can remember seeing some trolley buses, which I was familiar with ‘cause</p>
<p><em>Yeah </em></p>
<p>You know, used to use them all the time, but I remember me mum telling me that er, some of them were ‘specially constructed to go out to South Africa</p>
<p><em>Mhhmm</em></p>
<p>And I think they were, dunno if they were narrower or wider</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But they had the darkened windows, you know to stop the glare of the sun, and erm......yeah that’s just by the way [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>That’s just erm, part of Barking, of the park.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Oh I remember the erm....thinking of that, I think there used to be a, sort of ice cream kiosk at the gate</p>
<p><em>Mhmmm</em></p>
<p>I know they had the pavilion</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I think they called it, know where you could get your drinks</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And ice lollies and everything.</p>
<p><em>Mhmmm</em></p>
<p>But I seem to remember there was erm one just at the gate in Longbridge Road, but that might be me, might be memory</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>xxxx tricks but, but with the other one, I remember, I think that was an art deco</p>
<p><em>yeah</em></p>
<p>style</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Presumably that’s still there</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But I can particularly remember the lollies there and er, you know the creamy banana ones</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I used to have, or the erm, the ice lollies, the frozen erm...</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>The lime</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>I used to like [laughs] the lime flavour. I just liked the look of it and</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah just, well it was refreshing, you know</p>
<p><em>Yeah, um did you ever used to listen to bands playing at the bandstand?</em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>I don’t remember them. No if there was one, we probably would of sat down, ‘cause me mum used to like to, to do that [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>I wasn’t one for sitting down much, you know</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>But I remember different places we went to. She’d wanna sit down, I was like “come on let’s go!”</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>No, don’t....can’t really remember where the bandstand, I mean I’ve been over there, in more recent years</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But the last time is probably about, fifteen years ago, you know</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>.....I know there’s the war memorial there.</p>
<p><em>Mhmmm</em></p>
<p>That was fascinating and</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Impressive, and.....And I remember the lavatories as well. Just behind the erm, I was just, I think it must‘ve been between the Lido and the erm, ice cream place, the pavilion or, cafe area. I seem to remember they were sort of dirty and smelly and closed in and I hope they’ve altered it since then and er, you know made it a bit safer and</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>More, you know, more visible to the er, park keepers or whoever’s there [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>You know I wouldn’t wanna go in there now you know. Didn’t think about it much at the time</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But, but er, no I think you’d feel a bit vulnerable in there.</p>
<p><em>Mhmm, um did you used to take your children to Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>No, I don’t think I ever did.</p>
<p><em>Oh [laughs]</em></p>
<p>We lived in Newbury Park, and erm, so we used to go to Seven Kings park.</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Or Valentines. But I don’t think we ever went to erm, Barking Park.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>I might have done</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>But again that was forty years ago now [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Thirty-five years ago.</p>
<p><em>Um, do you remember like any sports bein’ played in the park at all.</em></p>
<p>......No, not from when I was a kid. At one point, I remember doin’ puttin’, you know little, little golf thing, puttin’ green. That might’ve been in the nineties when I went there with someone with her children</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>Or it might have been in the sixties, go over there with the girlfriend or summin’</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Just for, a ride out and er, but I seem to remember bein’ on a puttin’ green</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I think they used to play cricket over there. But I would never have sat in watched it.</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>I think, you know, got a vague recollection of seeing ‘em playing in the distance and...</p>
<p><em>Yeah, um, trying to think [laughs] </em></p>
<p>Alright</p>
<p><em>Like what else to say, erm, have you got any other memories of Barking Park?</em></p>
<p>Any other memories?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, at all</em></p>
<p>No, don’t think so, I made some notes, but I think you’ve covered them all.</p>
<p><em>Oh right</em></p>
<p>And you had the boats and the fishin’ and the railway and...Lido and the carnival.....No, summin’ might come back later but....</p>
<p><em>Ok [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[laughs] be too late, but er [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[laughs] </em></p>
<p>No I think geographically, you go from go inside the gate, you got the railway on the left and donkeys and the ponies on the right and</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And go further over to the right, you’ve got the Lido, the paddling pool and ....and sort of going along the otherside from one end to the other, you got the er boatin’ lake</p>
<p><em>Mhmm</em></p>
<p>And, no, that’s about it.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>What other memories have people come up with?</p>
<p><em>Erm</em></p>
<p>Any that I haven’t thought of? Or?</p>
<p><em>Few people have been talkin’ about erm, at-, a, I think it was either swan or duck that used to like bite people. </em></p>
<p>Oh really</p>
<p><em>Because I xxxx think, erm, think he was called Henry the swan.</em></p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p><em>I think</em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>So</em></p>
<p>Didn’t know that</p>
<p><em>[laughs] And erm, just been talkin’ about like the xxxxxxx, just like the Lido and the boats really. Most of the time. </em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>So.....and quite a lot of people have been talking about the carnivals and the fireworks</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and where have other people come from? Are they still local or have they not moved?</p>
<p><em>I think most of them are actually local, they live like right near the park, so</em></p>
<p>Mmmmmm....yeah, yeah I would like to’ve got along to one or two of the erm, like you know, to one of the erm, reminiscence sessions</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>You know, sort of talk to people about ‘em, but they're just a bit too far or not the right time</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But erm....yeah and you wonder things like that, I wonder if there’s any one that I knew, you know [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah that wasn’t far from me, ‘cause I lived in Plaistow</p>
<p><em>Yeah </em></p>
<p>So it was only a, xxxx even got the train, I think we just used walk up to the green gate in Plaistow and get the bus along</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>But the train would have gone just three stops on…yeah three stops and then a short walk</p>
<p><em>Mmh yeah</em></p>
<p>Yeah it was a good park to go to you know erm....XXXX West Ham Park, but that didn’t have a lido, although as I said I didn’t used to use it anyway</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>And it didn’t have the boating lake so there was more in Barking Park</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>To do you know</p>
<p><em>Did you…</em></p>
<p>And West Ham didn’t have the XXXX railway [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Or the donkeys, I don’t remember the donkeys or ponies there so…yeah looking back as you’ve just said that you know erm…there was a lot of activity in Barking Park</p>
<p><em>Yeah did you used to go to Barking Park a lot in the summer holiday?</em></p>
<p>I was just thinking that I can’t remember it raining when I was there, I mean really I can only remember a few particular occasions</p>
<p><em>Mmh</em></p>
<p>You know a lot of the two things were the paddling pool</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And the carnival and that, thing that stick in your mind…but I…I think I can only remember sunny days over there but then on the other hand if it had been a rainy day or if it looked like rain coming…my mum won’t have taken me anyway so</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>You know it was sort of selective you know go</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Nice day that’s get out, let’s go over Barking Park you know</p>
<p><em>Erm when you was like over Barking Park did you just used to the lido a lot or did you used to do other things in the Park?</em></p>
<p>Sorry when I used to?</p>
<p><em>Erm when you used to go over to Barking Park did you just used go into the lido or did you do other things as well?</em></p>
<p>No, I mean we probably only went in the afternoon…we might have made a day of it with sandwiches but…we might have just been like on a Sunday afternoon, just go over there for a couple of hours so by the time we had a ride on the donkeys and the ride on the train and then a walk round and…sit in the lido for a little while and a little play in the paddling pool and then a little go on the boats or something [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You know if we did all of them in one go</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Then that would have taken up the afternoon erm…but I’ve only got that one memory of the lido and that’s probably my first time in there</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Just being so amazed by it, how erm…I just sort of so many people and…the water and the colours</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And the freshness of it all you know the excitement</p>
<p><em>Yeah [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Did stick in my mind</p>
<p><em>Yeah erm can’t think of anything else to…</em></p>
<p>Did you go there?</p>
<p><em>Erm I haven’t really been over there, like before…I’ve been over there like a couple of times but cos where my nan lives, like she’s got a park right opposite like her house so I normally went to that one</em></p>
<p>Ah, what’s that central park?</p>
<p><em>Erm it’s the one, which is right near Becontree station, I’m not sure what the name is of that park</em></p>
<p>Ah I know Becontree station because I used to help people with the allotments next to it, but I don’t remember, I probably didn’t get that far into the park</p>
<p><em>Yeah so…</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Erm is there anything else you like to say cos I think of anymore questions</em></p>
<p>No, I did think today about someone who lives in Barking now and I don’t if she grew up there but I thought I will get in touch with her and erm tell her about the project</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>I mean she’s working full time but she might be able to…take part in it and erm…she still lives in Barking now</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>As far as I know</p>
<p><em>Ok yeah</em></p>
<p>Erm…yeah well if my cousin was still alive…but she lived up in Yorkshire anyway so she wouldn’t be able to help</p>
<p><em>Ok [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>But she might remember more</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Then just falling in the paddling pool</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And getting her knickers wet, but [Laughs] I’m sure she remembers that, or would have remembered it</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And…erm I don’t see my old mates now you know they’ve all moved away and erm</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>So erm I mean touch wood a couple of them, but…no it’s it</p>
