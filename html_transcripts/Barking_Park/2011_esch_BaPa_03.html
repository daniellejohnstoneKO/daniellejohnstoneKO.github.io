<p>Ooh yes, I used to look out of the window, because we look over the field, sport field and I used to always been told off [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] Day dreaming</em></p>
<p>Do your School Work, and um ooh yes I loved it there, and um then the War started, and um they came and put the Shelter in our back garden ,this um iron Shelters ,and ooh I hated the War, it was awful, because we lived in St.Awdrys Road, and the opposite side of the Road those houses back down to the Tilbury line err, train route there were two route ,one for the electric line, and one for the err ordinary engine line, and err we could hear this Gun coming up and down, the Tilbury line, you could hear it and you think ooh God here it goes again, and I always remember once my Mother, err the siren, when my Dad was a warden, air raid warden and we both of us got down the shelter, and um I was setting there praying, and my Mother poor Mother she was terrified, she said “look at you, you are not freighting of anything are you” and I looked at her, and said what you talking about, am saying it over and over again please God don’t let me die, I was I remember it, and um you know I was terrified xxx, and we had a big one of the big bombs, further down St.Awdrys and it err, bombed about half a dozen houses, wipe them out, and people were killed, and you see because we where near the docks and the river and xxx[Fords], they were making ammunition I think or whatever, and err that we were target, but we did had xxx some bad bombing in Barking, err yeah we finally got through the War, and err I had left School then. And err I started in the Post office, I wanted to be a Telephonist in the post office, but I had to go to School first, um sit my Civil Service Exams which I passed, and then I chose to go to xxx exchanged ,up off the East ends, in Convent garden, and um ooh that was partly during the war, because I also remember when the siren went, we were told by the supervisor to us two, because we were the youngest ,we were what fifteen the two youngest we had to go down the xxx and mind the emergency thing, and we just got down there after rushing like mad from the third floor up, and we just getting through the hole in the wall, and we heard this bomb go off, and we thought ooh my God we been hit, but we hadn’t but when I finished my shift in the afternoon, I went out and everybody been talking about it, it was the Air Ministry on the corner of xxx[Hornbeam] that was hit, and err I was absolutely terrified, there were all bits of cloth den and stuffs in the tress on the pavement ,where people had been killed.</p>
<p><em>Ooh my god</em></p>
<p>It was dreadful; it really was. But any way, I caught the train home and I told my Mother and you know she said yes you know, but err I should never forget that, walk coming out and seeing that, but that was the way it was then, you know we would be going along on the underground to up to London, and you would see West Ham, it only a small station, or it was then, and a bomb had dropped on those houses xxx and you could see that the err, the err shelters had come up the force of the blast ,had force them up out of the ground, and the sheet and things were hanging out either ends now whether they were anybody in them I don’t know, but often we would had to get off, and walked from one Station to another, because that Station had been hit, so it was quite hairy at a time you know, but then there were the Celebrations, but we were not allowed to go to them we had to go straight home [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Why you were not allowed to go celebrations</em></p>
<p>Well because the Canadians were in London, the Americans by that time had decided to joined in two years too late [laughing] And um they were having parties of you know the War was over and all you know, and we because we were young they said the supervisor said no you, we rather you didn’t go to them um, all the other older girls xxx[would] coming in the next day and tell us what a marvellous time they had [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>

<p>Yeah, yeah</p>
<p><em>Do you know what this area was like during the war years?</em></p>
<p>It was all farm land</p>
<p><em>All right ok</em></p>

<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>We had xxx</em></p>

<p>Ooh</p>
<p>So unfortunately they are still there, but people got worried you know about their children the effect on their children if they living too close to this power lines, but if nobody is prepared to fund it you can’t do it</p>
<p><em>Yes there is not lot you can do if there is no money for it xxx</em></p>

<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it marvellous I mean, the things like the park you know, I remember as a kid, my Mum and Dad taking me over there to the fairs, ooh it was great I used to look forward to it, and I was nor great shapes at going on roundabout I was sick [laughing] but I loved it, and then there was the boxing, they invited people men to come up and try their hand you know against one of the boxes</p>
<p><em>Ooh</em></p>
<p>And err all sorts of side shows, and things, and popcorn and stuff like that, and um ooh it was [cough] it was so happy you know everybody was laughing and joking and um it was, ooh it was crowded over Barking Park, I used to loved, ooh once they had a big Viking thing, um men dressed up as err Vikings, terrified I hide, heed behind my Dad [laughing]</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] </em></p>
<p>Ooh and they got these spears and xxx and things and then they decorated some of the long boat in the lake, and they were going up and down, I really thought they were Vikings [laughing] but they xxx and ooh it was marvellous, you know but during the war the park, they build prefabs over there, right down near the Abbey School end, you know where the school is? They build prefabs because they had troops, and guns in the park, and they had to had this prefabs for the troops to be in, and god when they used to let xxx and err [cough] you could hear them guns bang, bang you know in the night and</p>
<p><em>Could you even hear them from where you were living?</em></p>
<p>Ooh yes, xxx St. Awdrys roads that opposite Barking Station</p>
<p><em>Ooh ok</em></p>
<p>Where xx[you] go down steps and through err, a walk way</p>
<p><em>So not too far at all then from you</em></p>
<p>No, no and um, but err what am gonna say yeah. And any way they moved, when the troops moved out and took the guns, when the War was over, they even put people who they couldn’t house in those prefabs, because there was a family moved up stairs here, out of one of the prefabs they were giving, then they moved off to a house, um but err ooh yeah they were, those guns god, and then the gun opposite, on the opposite side of the road, at the back at the end of there, back gardens god when that let xxx frighten the life out of you</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>But um, it was lot of things going on in the park you know, all sorts of things. I used to loved going, xx as a kid, when I got to age off ten, eleven, we would go over there, and they won’t be any fair of anything happen to you, you know I doubted very much this days, that people allowed their children to go over there on their own, but we would go over there, and we play on the swing on the roundabout and thing like that and it was great fun</p>
<p><em>Can you remember your very –very first memory of the park do you know roughly how old would you have been when you first went there</em></p>
<p>Ooh, what it would be when my Mum and Dad took me to the xxx[fair] I should think, yeah because it would be weekend, because as I said my Mum and Dad, worked</p>
<p>Um</p>
<p>So I wouldn’t get much chance of been taking over there during the week, and when they built the Lido, ooh that was marvellous we thought it was marvellous, when my children were little, I xxx [would] make a picnic, and we go over there, and sit on the back park which was the Lido you know, and had a picnic and you would see all your friends, with their children but the water was enough cold</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>It was freezing, and yet it would be a hot Summer day, but it was a lovely swimming pool and I felt it was such a shame when we lost it, see Dagenham had lost theirs, I suppose they figure ooh well, and Barking could lose their [laughing]</p>

<p><em>You know roughly how much it would have cost to get in at that time?</em></p>
<p>Ooh xxx[blame] not a lot, I shouldn’t think [laughing] about six pence I should think something like that, when you think about today moneys [laughing] yeah xxx[I would think]] round about six pence something like that</p>

<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>Right that how it is there, now this Conner ,when that all went to the wall, this Conner was taken over by xxx[short mate bowl Centre]and they spend alot of money, alot of their own money, and this Conner , they took out this Conner just this little bit on the Conner</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And as I said, they worked very - very hard they painted they put things in they build a nice kitchen, one err, one wing went down this way, and about three wings went down that way, now on the outside they were plants climbing up the outside and it look really pretty that Conner, this was all wipe away the actual swimming pool, was drained and it was nothing, err that bit down there was xxx[shut] off, that bit, that bit , that bit was xx[shut] off, this you could get in but it was not used er this Conner was used, and the bit at the bark, the bit at the bark here, was turned into a community room, where the community could seat and do things, and papers were kept you know filing cabinet, so it sort of extended there just a little bit, now they kept it absolutely first class clean and everything, they had a good attendance very sociable anybody could joined, they even started up err a disable</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Group and they were wonderful, absolutely wonderful, I used to go in there sometimes because xxx um I knew her very well good friend of mine, and I would go in there and stay and watch them, and they will say “you come in you play bowls” so I said no I can’t play bowls you teach me [laughing] you know</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>And they said “yeah I will teach you, I teach you” and it was hilarious I would deliberately make a mistake, and it would roll off of the carpet, and they would fall about laughing and they come and put it in my hand xxx and then I will get one strike, and they go ooh yeah xxx[look, look]</p>
<p><em>Ooh </em></p>
<p>And they where been in xxx you know they taught me to bowl</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And it was lovely, and every any time I went in there, they will recognise me, and talk and they played in this one going up this way, and the other one was the ordinary people, there was three wings, two or three wings I don’t know can’t remember, and err it was great, it was for the people in the area they paid for it everything themselves, and there was no reason for them they could have knock all the rest of it down, taking the pool out, or filled it in with earth made err nice green with seats and for the old people and for toddlers and that top play in, put some nice bushes xxx[things] there all the rest of it could been pull down except for this bit</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>And that would seat there, it was nicely decorated, nice pretty flowers round it, and it could had stayed there</p>
<p><em>Right so you fell that it was unnecessarily </em></p>
<p>It was totally unnecessary, and I told the Councillor that, and I told the Council, but somebody there wanted them out</p>
<p><em>Right</em></p>
<p>And I think that was so bad, they gave them room up at the new complex up at XXX [Becontree Heat] I mean, why? The people lived round here, you know and they didn’t asked for anything, they didn’t cost anything but now they got to pay for their time there</p>
<p><em>Ooh really</em></p>
<p>And I don’t know whether the disable still go there or not</p>
<p><em>I heard that they had to keep the original 1930xxx so that might have hinder any plans they had to knock down the rest but I thought that was part of the heritage lottery funding</em></p>
<p>Ooh they put the xxx the whole lot down</p>
<p><em>Ooh, no the original front entrance wall xx they kept that</em></p>
<p>Have they?</p>
<p><em>The bit down the side, I think they taking out</em></p>
<p>I haven’t been up there, I would have go up there and have a look</p>
<p><em>Yeah and they preserved the fountains as well which is why I ask about the earlier </em></p>
<p>Yeah that is right</p>
<p><em>So they have preserved bits of it but I don’t know obviously they extent to what went on with you know the bowls club unfortunately</em></p>
<p>No, I fought tooth and nail over them and I was so upset, when they had to go because xxx has work her socks off I mean ,she is same age as me probably, and she work her socks off, and they made money and build thing there and it wasn’t necessary, that Conner could had been kept there</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>As a historical reminder, and err I was really angry. I said who has decree that this is gone nobody would tell me</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>But there was a reason, there was a reason I think</p>
<p><em>It will be interesting to find out what that reason was xxx</em></p>
<p>I would loved to know, because am angry, I am really angry because it broke xxx heart</p>
<p><em>Really</em></p>
<p>She put so much work in to it, and she doesn’t xxx [that] nobody likes it, where they are, I think they have lost members. But there you go, if I had been on the Council they wouldn’t had lost it</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>[Coughing]</p>
<p><em>It quite sad</em></p>
<p>But err I think that was, that was bad, very bad</p>
<p>Um</p>
<p>They said why couldn’t they have gone into the ordinary bowl centre, it wouldn’t have gone, it wouldn’t have fitted in, you can’t have short mate in with full length of mate you know, it would mean crossing over and wearing out the carpet</p>
<p><em>I think the person who gave me the film of it said u, I think it was a section of the film; the mates were really, really heavy so obviously if you laid them out on top of something else you xx sort of rolled them out and put them back up again </em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>Where as in the place they had apparently could leave them out full times so </em></p>
<p>Yeah that right</p>
<p><em>So it was just easier for everyone I think that what I heard any way </em></p>

<p>Well, Barking area, how it changed [laughing]</p>
<p><em>Would you like to talk about that for a little bit you know describing what way you think it changed? </em></p>
<p>Well it changed, because of the high rise flats in the Town Centre, which I don’t all together like, its taking away the shopping things it close down, we haven’t got any nice shop in Barking decent shop, we did had a Marks and Spencer , we had a Woolworth, Woolworth was here for years, and when I was on the Council, when Marks and Spencer closing and I went in, I saw the manager, and I said please don’t go, and he look down he xxx at me and he said “we don’t take enough money here” he said “the people don’t spend money you know” he said “we are going to sell it off and put the money in Ilford Marks and Spencer” I said err thanks so that killed Barking</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>I said well if you had some a bit more err assortment of things, I said but you are very restricted I said you could spread, you could spread out quite a bit, I said but you haven’t but he wouldn’t listen to me he is very xxx</p>
<p><em>Um</em></p>
<p>And I think that, I think that was a shame, but err and of course you know it not enough, there is not enough space now, to put any decent development, I mean xxx[what is the ] biggest shop we got this um Wilkinson, am glad that stay, but um when the market is not there, it is dead</p>
