<p><em>Ok so this is Claire Days interviewing Mrs Freeman on the 28<sup>th</sup> of October 2011 for the Barking Park Oral History project. If I can ask just say your full name and date of birth please?</em></p>
<p>Yeah er my name is Elizabeth Freeman And I was born on the 16<sup>th</sup> March 1941.</p>
<p><em>1941 brilliant. And can I ask where you were born please?</em></p>
<p>I was born at erm, Ilford Maternity Hospital erm up in the Eastern Avenue it was.</p>
<p><em>And what did your parents do for work?</em></p>
<p>My mother didn’t work because women didn’t work then, er well my, my mother didn’t work and my father worked for Shell and BP and he drove a lorry taking erm, petrol to the airports, the aerodr-dromes yeh, erm, yeah that’s what he did.</p>
<p><em>That sounds like quite an interesting job</em></p>
<p>Yeh, dangerous job</p>
<p><em>Oh</em></p>
<p>But yes, because during the war time, when, when I was born he would be driving along with, not allowed to have headlights on, no allowed to have lights on at all and of course er, aerodromes would be military places that were a target for bombs. So it was a high risk job and so that’s probably why he didn’t have to get called up for the second world war.</p>
<p><em>Right so it’s a reserved occupation </em></p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p><em>...because of the importance of it</em></p>
<p>It, it was the job he had, was important to the, the war really</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Delivering the petrol yeah</p>
<p><em>Did he ever talk about getting frightened sort of driving around in the blackout and things like that.</em></p>
<p>He did use to talk about how he couldn’t see ahead of him sometimes it was so dark if there was no moon and have to get out to have a look to see where the road went in the, the roads signs were not there, they’d all been taken down in the war.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]That’s quite a good memory then to find his way around.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah</p>
<p><em>Crikey, that sounds like quite an experience doesn’t it </em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>Did you ever, did you ever talk to your father about war time experiences </em></p>
<p>Erm</p>
<p><em>That you may have been too young to remember</em></p>
<p>No I was born during the war and erm I was four when it finished and to me I didn’t know anything different so you don’t, wouldn’t have thought it was anything out of the way, to have a war ‘cause that’s all you knew and erm, no I didn’t no.</p>
<p><em>Oh, ok, that’s, that’s fine. </em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>So, so what schools in the area did you go to?</em></p>
<p>I went to South Park School</p>
<p><em>South Park School </em></p>
<p>In erm, in Water Lane yeah</p>
<p><em>And how did you find that?</em></p>
<p>Hated it</p>
<p><em>Oh dear</em></p>
<p>Hated it</p>
<p><em>Why did you hate it?</em></p>
<p>Well one of the reasons why I never played with other children because they, most of them been evacuated and there would like be one or two children around that erm, I saw occasionally but I’d s-, never had an experience with playing erm, brought up in a very fearful er, situation of your not out of, if you don’t go out of your mother’s eye sight because of the war. You know everyone had to be close by in case the warning went and erm, yes so when I was then taken to school it was a very traumatic experience to be erm, taken away from my mother and put on amoungst a whole sea of faces that I didn’t even know these children. Who were they? You know? And I certainly didn’t like the teachers, they were very severe.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing]</em></p>
<p>But I didn’t settle at all well but erm, I was ok once I got to secondary school. I never liked any of it at the school there, very w-, the reception teacher was ok, but it was after, I had a very strict teacher, oppressive it was. Cla-, over fifty in a classroom, erm, I can just....</p>
<p><em>People complain about child class sizes these days </em></p>
<p>I know, I could just remember the rainy days when you couldn’t get out, cooped up in there, and the smell of school dinners</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>Mince meat, y-[laughing]</p>
<p><em>[laughing] and cabbage! [Laughing] I remember that smell well. So er, I do understand that wow. So it, so wh-, what secondary school did you go to?</em></p>
<p>I went to Mayfield, erm, which was</p>
<p><em>[there you go]</em></p>
<p>For the first year, it was in Goodmayes Lane erm, because they were building a new school at Chadwell Heath, and then when I was erm, twelve, we transferred to the new school at Chadwell Heath. That was lovely, nice big field hmmm, that was a nice school there. And the teachers were nice.</p>
<p><em>So was that the biggest difference from you, between primary and secondary school then was the fact that the teachers were nicer and that’s why you enjoyed it more?</em></p>
<p>Erm, it couldn’t see out of the windows at South Park School, they were frosted windows, very cramped erm, it was like a prison cell, I felt yeah. And also I was young erm, but at the secondary school the teachers were not oppressive, they were very much more laid back and friendly and smiley and erm, allowed children to sort of develop and really saw what your talents were. And so people that had been told they were no good all the time you know and there was loads of us, never any good, well nothing much expected of us at South Park, erm, when we got to Mayfield, the world was our oyster yeah.</p>
<p><em>Wasn’t that fabulous!</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah that was good</p>
<p><em>It’s really inspiring to hear about teachers that allow their students t-, t-, you know to develop in that way isn’t it.</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>No, it’s really lovely </em></p>
<p>I think I was, I did have one teacher at South Park School that was lovely and his, he was Mr Hart and I’d actually gone down in to the bottom grade ‘cause I was doing so poorly [laughing] and I came top of his class but he had a different approach to these other teachers. His was very much you help each other and one child sat and helped another one and erm, praising lots of praise and lots of erm, opportunities to just develop as a normal being ....yes, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Nice</em></p>
<p>I thought some of these other people were a bit warped</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] What do you think there was an element of them, because of the period that you went to school that it would have been sort of almost like old Victorians or...</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>So, do you think there was an element of that?</em></p>
<p>I remember their laced up shoes and their thick knit stockings and erm, glasses down the end of the row, nose and it was very erm, not e-, not every single one but erm, several of them stand out of in my mind as being very strict with young children probably they were teaching the wrong age group I would think. Yeah</p>
<p><em>Ok, but that’s really interesting, you know to hear about the contrast of the teaching style, I think that’s, quite relevant today as well so thank you, thank you, thank you for telling me about that. So what did you do when you left school?</em></p>
<p>Erm, when I left school, erm, I got a job in the civil service in, in the Inland Revenue</p>
<p><em>Oooh lovely. And how did you find that job? Did, did you erm, was it advertised? Or was it through friends that you heard about it?</em></p>
<p>No, my mum found it from a neighbour worked there and her neighbour erm, arranged for me to, well, told us of a job going at Gants Hill and I went for an interview and got this job. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>I just stayed there seven years. Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>And after that seven years, did you stop working to have a family or..?</em></p>
<p>No after that seven years I went on a bus over land to India.</p>
<p><em>Oh fabulous</em></p>
<p>I gave up my job and went round the world for two years.</p>
<p><em>That’s ok for some isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and then when I came back, I went to train to be a teacher. [laughing]</p>
<p><em>So after your bad experiences of teachers.... </em></p>
<p>I made sure everyone had a nice time, I hope.</p>
<p><em>Ok. So if, if it’s ok, if I can just jump back a little bit now, erm, I know that you said you were a member of the Red cr- er St John’s Ambulance</em></p>
<p>St John’s Ambulance yes</p>
<p><em>When, when was it you would’ve joined them? </em></p>
<p>I first went there when I was ten. Erm, can’t remember how we came to hear about it, probably a friend of mine’d mother heard about it and we both went together. And erm, that was in erm, Barking</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>A school at, I forgotten what the schools called near, near the Upney Station, erm, just before you get to it s-, there’s a school in a side road there, forgotten what its called. But anyway that’s where we used to go, and that was, that was quite nice.</p>
<p><em>Was that Barking Abbey School by the .....</em></p>
<p>No, beyond there where it might be part of Barking Abbey now</p>
<p><em>Oh right ok.</em></p>
<p>I think it might be actually</p>
<p><em>Right ok</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Yeah I probably don’t remember what it would...</em></p>
<p>Near that clinic, near th-, near the walk-in centre.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I think that’s what I’m thinking</em></p>
<p>Yes not far from there opposite that</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>So, was that a kind of, an open thing that anybody could go along to and join?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah</p>
<p><em>So, so wh-, what was it about the St, St John’s ambulance that really appealed to you?</em></p>
<p>Oh, I liked to learning to do bandages, that was f-, quite fun really you know, you got taught how to every limb and er, how to do a bit of first aid. They obviously made it fun enough to get, keep you going</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>So how, how old would’ve you been when you actually started doing events and things with them.</em></p>
<p>Erm, xxxxxxx [paper crushing noises]</p>
<p><em>Sorry [laughing]</em></p>
<p>Erm, I’ve got dates on these xxxx. As I got in to my teens xxx we got more. I was more active in it you know.</p>
<p><em>Right </em></p>
<p>Oh we-, we had to earn our, learn our code of Chivalry and erm, we used to have to memorise this and we used to have to do Marching around as well so we did drill practise and bandaging. They broke the evening up a bit you know and then erm, a hospital duties, you could do</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And then in 1954, that’s when I was 13, we, because we did all this marching and that we, we were taken to places. We used to erm, we, we went up to erm, Hype Park there and I can remember that erm, Princess Margaret was there and erm, I can remember her sort of standing with people from St john’s, people from all over the country all in parade for ages and ages and ages a-, in rows and we were told to stand easy but then when we had to stand to attention we had to flex your knees every now and again so that you don’t faint.</p>
<p><em>Oh </em></p>
<p>Things like that</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>And then we had the March past and everything and that was all in the paper about that. Erm, we had different displays that our parents could come to a-, we, we were</p>
<p><em>Oh fabulous</em></p>
<p>...worked for certificates much like in the guides and er, got presentations for certificates and erm, then in 1954 the same, the same year erm, there was this thing at St Pauls Cathedral for any one er, for us to go to. It was very special that. And then in 1955 I obviously dropped off because erm, Miss Kindon who was our leader wrote to my mother to say I’m wondering about Elizabeth, I haven’t seen her at class for a while. And then she, you know cause of the school holidays and that, she said about there bein-, there was a outing, which I had missed and then she said now for coming events and she said there’s a first aid competition and there’s a home nursing c-, oh there’s a h-, first aid competition in October for the Donald Mckenzie shield, a home nursing competition for the Dristle Cup</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>And an open evening to which we invite parents. So there was plenty of things to aim for and I did enjoy that time. And we used to go out and one, well on this was erm, here I am in team of four and won this cup</p>
<p><em>Oh wow</em></p>
<p>And because we often, the bed making competition and with the first aid competitions you go on a Saturday, the team of four and erm, there’d be someb-, in a school in East Ham and there’d be somebody made f-, dressed up and painted up as if they’d had an accident or ill or something and they’d be laying there and you had to use all your first aid skills by erm, pretending it’s real and asking them how they felt and where it hurt and all this and making sure that people kept back and all that sort of-, as if it was the real thing. Any way we won the competitions and because of that then erm, she took us up to see this xxxx sport at the White City Stadium</p>
<p><em>Oh Fabulous</em></p>
<p>Now, this</p>
<p><em>So that was your treat for doing so well at that event</em></p>
<p>A reward was really yes, and erm because of the targets of you can do certificates like you could do them in erm, I did one in Pressed f-, collecting pressed flowers and writing up a book about flowers</p>
<p><em>Oh lovely</em></p>
<p>That’s one thing I did, there was, but there were twelve different exams. The first aid was definitely important in it, and then I got the Grand Prior badge which was erm the highest award you can, you can get.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>So not many people get the Grand Prior but you know you had to pass a lot of exams and, and then you get this Grand Prior. Erm....</p>
<p><em>That’s fabulous</em></p>
<p>And then I.....</p>
<p><em>So how, how old were you when you won the, that Grand Prior?</em></p>
<p>Hmmm I’m not sure what age I was exactly there was a s-, no, yeah I think you had to do it before a certain age so I’d been a teenager.</p>
<p><em>Right, oh wow so you were quite young as well</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>It’s quite an achievement isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Well in fifty-seven, or have I got, or was I wearing my Gran prior then? You wore it on the sleeve, can’t see that girl’s heads in the way</p>
<p><em>[laughing]</em></p>
<p>Erm, I can’t remember, erm, I’ve got all this, oh yeah, I’ve got all the certificates at home. That’s what the Grand Prior looks like, that.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>That’s a big shield isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, er, actually, yes, actually all the, all the certificates I should put in here and I’ll come back and tell you.</p>
<p><em>[Laughing] That’s fine. If you can find them.</em></p>
<p>I know where they are.</p>
<p><em>They haven’t escaped down the back or something [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><em>No, I mean that’s great, it’s great that you’ve got so many photos of it</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>As well so</em></p>
<p>And we used to do hospital duties and first aid duties in public places and up at theatres in London</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Probably more when I got into the adult section though the erm…the theatres in London, but as…a teenager I used to go to the hospitals and then you’d get badges for how many hours you done</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>You do two hundred hours…service in hospitals and you’d get a badge</p>
<p><em>Sorry something attacking you down there [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>It’s my pen [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Oh right [Laughs] so you would have obviously spent quite a lot of time in Barking then</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>As a youngster</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Is there anything in particular at Barking itself that kind of stands out in your memory from those times?</em></p>
