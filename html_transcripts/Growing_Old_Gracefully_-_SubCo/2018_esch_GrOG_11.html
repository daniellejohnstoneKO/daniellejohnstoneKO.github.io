<p>[Laughs] this much. [Laughs] I’m exciting, yeh, I’m, if I got married I got new clothes, I got new shoe, I got new jewellery, this much, it didn’t do anything worth it.</p>
<p><em>What was the, um, wedding like? </em></p>
<p>Wedding, wedding is ni-, um, good wedding, but, um, I’m really nervous, nervous because everything, everything new for me. My father coming to my wedding XXXX (0:10:49), my mother in India, other, other, all family in, only my father’s coming to my India. Everything, everything new to, traditional and erm, I can’t say anything, that’s the problem. Today I’m say anything, I’m in XXXX (0:11:04) at the moment, but that time, I’m n-, no my choice, anything.</p>
<p><em>Erm</em></p>
<p>XXXX (0:11:09) I’m just looking, seeing the what have brought, that’s it.</p>
<p><em>Sounds quite hard </em></p>
<p>Yeh, hard back there. 1984.</p>
<p><em>Was the, um, what was the area around here like back in the 80s? Was it different to how it is now?</em></p>
<p>Yeh, lots of different that time. No rush like this, I didn’t heard of crime, that time. You knows if somebody now is uh, anyone, any married, erm, our culture go to the XXXX (0:11:44) other cultures, very girlfriend, boyfriend. But that time, no, no, no. ‘Cos, my cousin’s sister they’re my auntie’s granddaugh-, daughter, she likes someone, you know what, what is angry family? “Kill him, we kill him”. ‘Cos, uh, mostly, uh, nobody heard XXXX (0:12:06), the other, other culture boyfriend, girlfriend, this type of. Nothing that.</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>That time, I never heard. She done one mistake, his family is say “We kill her, we kill his wife and his family”. This much anger, this much anger to family.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>Yeh, that time, nobody do it like this. No girlfriend, boyfriend</p>
<p><em>Why, why was it such a big problem?</em></p>
<p>Because, that time is tradit-, more, maybe culture wise, strict. Maybe, you know, mostly, now every house somebody find a girlfriend, boyfriend, anyone now. We, if I’m place, I know, not my daughter doing, mostly doing that. That time, nobody doing that. That’s why if something different, decide that children is shocked fairly. Yeh, you can’t do that, because other cultures marry to other culture.</p>
<p><em>Mm</em></p>
<p>This is not traditional. This is our culture, no married to other, other one. We, we don’t decide, family decide that. Marriage, no, um, nobody choose that, okay I want to met her, I want to choose her, want to see the person, I want to talk to the person, no. Family decide it.</p>

<p><em>So after you got married presumably you moved out of your uncle and aunt’s house?</em></p>

<p><em>Yeh</em></p>

Doesn’t matter family, everybody got family issue, but, need to trust to listen somebody. Not if I visit somebody I tell to my other colleagues, tell to other people. That’s why I told aunties “Don’t share everybody told your things, personal things. Share one person. Build your trust, keep in the mind”</p>
<p><em>Yeh</em></p>
<p>Not tell them, my colleague, you know this son? Do you know this? that’s not nice. But one thing good if somebody trust you, I’m happy if somebody trust me, somebody share me I’m happy. I’m happy myself! Can, can she trust me? That’s important to me</p>
<p><em>Yeh</em></p>
<p>Yeh, I never… trust broken. One thing, honesty. I’m very honest person, everybody know. When I’m coming here to the job, apply the job, three lady to interview. XXXX (0:29:08) I’m sitting chair here, I’m really shocked, three ladies get to my interview, then, I tell them my other experience, I’m one care home but care home at the XXXX (0:29:19) that time I’m working there as well. Um, I tell the truth, I said what did you write? This journal going in the inside, what island? I tell these things. Erm, lots of talk, XXXX (0:29:39) erm, he ask “what do you speak and what do you doing in the care home?” I said “the care home we give the shower and the write in the paper, but not in the shower, this thing I don’t like it” you know? But this is lying things. He said, he hear nobody, we doing, not pretending. That night I tell honest everything I tell my XXXX (0:30:06) when I go home my daughter said, younger daughter, “Mum, how you my interview?” I said “tell this things…” “Mummm, how do you give the job to you? Why you telling these things? Why you do, do, why you telling your experience? What is the other one doing XXXX (0:30:26) I said “Ok. That’s fine if you don’t give me job, that’s fine. But I, I love my honesty. I’m sleep peacefully because I’m honest.” She said “look, no no call tell me any more for you because you, you tell the truth. You, honesty not working everywhere” I say, “Ok, that’s fine. The phone not coming”. Second day I’m going work then uh, I told my daughter, phone not coming, still don’t know I got job or not? She said “Mum you call, then after, you know the peace of mind that you’ve got.” At twelve o’clock I call, they soon pick up the phone, I said “I’m Sukhwinder Kaur speaking, uh, I got interview, what has happened?” She said “we called yesterday your home number and, yes you got job” That’s, I’m proud myself. I told my daughter “look! Honesty’s working.” I, I got more confidence to make the honest, if I done wrong I accept it, if I, anything done right, I said yes. I done wrong, sorry, next time I’m not doing anything. If I’m done wrong, I, I, I’m not apologising anyone. That’s, this, this is me.</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>I proud myself, still I’m 54 year old, I’m everywhere honest. As straight, as straight to face. I tell the straight to face. Everywhere, my family, my daughters, my chris-, uh friends, know me very well XXXX (0:32:05) sometimes you need to more shy</p>

And nobody help the colleague do that, big big people and I, ask for the help, nobody helping me. For the, I can’t manage this kind of, uh, I don’t like working there.

<p>Yeh, this, this, this, my thinking. ‘Kay, least I’m give the chapatti, two chapatti, I’m satisfied. After I’m cleaning, work everything, and clean otherside, yeh. Maybe he’s right as well, let to little exercise, but my satisfaction, satisfaction like this [laughs], this is me [laughs]</p>

<p><em>[laughs] </em></p>
<p>This my satisfaction, this my satisfaction. That’s why, I’m doing like this.</p>
<p><em>That’s excellent</em></p>
<p>Yeh [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Erm, I think I’ve sort of run out of questions that I had to ask you, but is there anything else you’d like to add? Or any stand out memories of working at SubCo that…?</em></p>
<p>Uh, I told you memories, good memories</p>
<p><em>Mm</em></p>
<p>Everything nice. Different to my other work</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>I got lots of confidence here, and I brought my honesty [to] work here, my honesty work here. Trust my, my manager, trust me if I say anything, he “yes, she’s right”</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>She trust, that’s the big thing. If, if you, if somebody trust you, this the big achievement, big achievement</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>If I lie, I tell the liar. If I’m mistake, I tell sorry, I tell her “yes, I done mistake”. If if I did a mistake I just accept these things. If ask me somebody XXXX (1:03:31) this is a lie, like, if I done something you ask me, tell the reason why you done these things. Not suddenly shout me</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>Let me chance to explain me. Maybe, my behind thinking different. If I say something, you take two way: positive or negative. This is totally different. If I say something to any, anyone, uhh, maybe she not like me, that’s what she done. If she didn’t know she’s my friend, she know me very well. She, she done for me things, totally different. Positive or negative. That’s the… if I done something, somebody ask me, can you just explain me why you say this word to me? Otherwise SubCo is brilliant, yeh.</p>
<p><em>Mm</em></p>
<p>But, uh, I think this job’s, this year because I buy new home in Coventry</p>
<p><em>In Coventry?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I’m moving there, I’m moving there</p>
<p><em>How long left have you got at SubCo?</em></p>

<p>Uhhh I try to end of year, because we settled now there, moving buy the new things, everything because uh, new house, we buy new things as well</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>Because uh, here is too expensive. That’s why my husband, and mother in law, my mother in law give the house, sold them, we sell it, and uh, I tell my husband “here, we can’t buy another house, and mortgage” XXXX (1::05:10) that’s why, my husband is sixty one year old, lets go to countryside and less work, more time by self. Enjoy the life now.</p>
<p><em>That seems like a…</em></p>
<p>Yeh, and ‘cos I work, I told you, 1984, work. This much of hard work: day, night, I work. Kill myself</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>
<p>Yeh, my colleague told me, “you not retire easily!” Yeh, because you killing yourself. ‘Cos I need the money. That’s why. Now, I want to spend my life to look after myself. Yeh, that’s why we decide like this. Otherwise, SubCo… I told my, uh, everyone, “we miss you, miss you”. I said, “yeh, you miss me, but one thing I’m thinking, maybe future, I, somebody need me. Some auntie, some uncle, where I’m working other place in there, maybe I met the people, if I’m, go to my life how to come in my, other people my life.</p>
<p><em>Yeh </em></p>

But, if not, you not going other people my life. How to make my other friends my life. Lots of people come in my life, I’ve worked so many place. Its good my life, new people in my life.
