<p><strong>Volunteer interview 2 – Madhu Raichura</strong></p>
<p>My name is Madhu Raichura. I joined SubCo as I was feeling myself lonely. I joined for socialising. We go to the seaside, we have programmes, and parties, and things like that… When I joined here there were certain members that comforted me a lot and told me to come to SubCo more often. I have been coming to SubCo since 2000, I think… There was a youth club a while ago, and there were youngsters coming around.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer interview 3 – Madhu Raichura</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy socialising. I’ve met new friends, many activities, going out, seaside and parties, and all those things. I enjoy music a lot. I went with SubCo to too many places, overseas as well, seaside also… SubCo is important for me because I don’t feel lonely. I socialise with everyone and enjoy myself. I started coming to SubCo because I was feeling lonely and depressed.</p>
<p>My memories are the ones that when I had hard times I had certain friends, whom I have lost them now, they used to comfort me and make me think positively instead of negatively.</p>
<p>My loneliness is not there anymore; I enjoy myself and I am happy when I go home.</p>
<p>We can celebrate SubCo’s 25th anniversary in many ways, like more people knowing, more leaflets around, and more activities.</p>
<p>SubCo can improve after twenty-five years… I think it will improve a lot because it is expanding a lot. There are so many projects going around, so many activities going around. Only thing we are missing is the meals. I t was really good when we used to have hot meals over here. Still we do have but that was a bit different.</p>
<p>The staff at SubCo are very good, very nice, very polite.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 4 – Hansa bin Patel</strong></p>
<p>My name is Hansa bin Patel. I started coming to SubCo in 2007. I was told about SubCo by my GP and the surgeon who was going to do my operation; they arranged SubCo for me. I started coming to SubCo because I have got some depression and some mental problem. I like here. The people are very nice and they respect us. And it’s very friendly.  My favourite thing about SubCo is playing games and talking with each other. I enjoy Bingo the most. When we have got gathering and some parties I enjoy too much… SubCo has improved a lot, they have new things, they have opened new sessions for the elderly people to enjoy. Young people come in SubCo when we did some planting in some small pots. I liked working with young children.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 8 – Second half English – Kanta Patel (?)</strong></p>
<p>I joined SubCo because I was alone in my house, so I like to socialise with other people. Everybody feels like a family here… SubCo is like my house. My family are also happy with me coming to the centre. My husband used to come here, and we went to the seaside together. It was a good memory… First my husband had a stroke, then he started to come here. When he was alive I used to come to the parties here as well with him, and then when he passed away I started to come regularly here.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 13 – English</strong></p>
<p>I started coming to SubCo about four years back. I knew SubCo for a long, long time, but I decided, through my social worker, because this was about the time where I needed to go somewhere. The people there can care for me because I am not as strong as I used to be… They are always there for me whenever I need any help, or anything. Any little to big thing, they are always there for me. Even if I’m not here, it’s only a phone call away. I like to meet people, because all my life I’ve been volunteering… Being mingled with the public… I talk to staff, I talk to members, or otherwise I’ll be depressed at home… Oh! I have seen so many changes. It’s always changed for the better.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 15 - English</strong></p>
<p>My name is Mrs Hardeep Sanghar. I live in East London. I started coming to SubCo about 4 years back. I knew SubCo from long time; I used to pop in and out. But actually I started because my health was deteriorating and my social worker suggested it, if I go there… so I said, ‘Okay’, that’s it… I like everything. They’re always there. If I have any problem I talk to them. Plus I love to do the entertainment. And the other thing is I come once a week and we do the chair-based exercises with another lady, because I’m trained for chair based exercise for the elderly people. There always there, just phone call away. Even if I’m not there, just call them, that’s it… We get together, we have a good time, we go out… We always enjoy our day! They’re very caring, all the staff… They always improve, day by day.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteer interview 16 - English first half</strong></p>
<p>I am Mrs Sirani Sapad. I have been coming to SubCo since it started, about 22 years I’ve been with them. My aunty bought me here actually because my aunty comes to SubCo, and she said, ‘You come’, because I come from Kenya and had nowhere to go, so she brought me here. So that I can meet people and get used to what the life… SubCo is important to me because I can come to SubCo any time. When I come here I enjoy myself and I don’t feel lonely. I like the staff of SubCo because they are very helpful. When we come here we enjoy it, the company we have, and they help us in any way we want. When we came here we didn’t know where to go. SubCo started to take us out, to movies, they took us to parks, they took us to seasides, and whenever we wanted to go shopping they would help us with shopping as well… When we come to SubCo we do dramas, we have some classes here, we sing, we dance, and we enjoy with all the people who come here. My favourite memory of SubCo is when we have parties here, we get together, we sing songs, we sit down and are talking to each other. SubCo helps with all the information. Whatever information we can’t get outside, we get here in SubCo… SubCo is like a second home to me, because at home, when we are not feeling well, we are lonely, we come to SubCo and we forget all our problems. The staff make us feel better… I think we love when we come here, we have these programmes with young children. We feel young with them. We used to enjoy working with them or playing with them, and do whatever they do. It makes us feel young. SubCo staff is very helpful, and they always help you, and they’re always there whenever we need them… SubCo has improved a lot actually. What they have now they have slowly slowly built up. Before there was nothing, only one little room. Now SubCo has become a big place. There were only a few people. But we can see it growing, and all the changes have made SubCo a good place.</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 20 – English (fragmented)</strong></p>
<p>Reka Goya (?) – I started coming to SubCo a long time ago, I don’t remember exactly. Maybe 20 years. I came here for a lot of things. Mainly social gathering and meeting people. There were parties and outings, singing and dancing… There used to be talking and food, dancing, singing… These sorts of things… Helping me socialise was the main thing. I didn’t make friends here particularly, I already had friends and they used to come too… It’s a very good thing for disabled and deprived people who can’t go out. At least they can see and talk to each other, meet friends, and go on outings. At the Trinity centre there used to be yoga and exercises. Knitting was my favourite, and embroidery. I liked meeting friends and sharing food… Staff was excellent, very caring, very helpful… I didn’t like the buildings very much, then they moved to some other part…</p>

<p><strong>Volunteer interview 25 – English (some not in English)</strong></p>
<p>My name is XXXX… I think July or August, 2009. Council referred me, because my wife passed away on June 25<sup>th</sup> 2009. After that I was getting depression, so they told me to go to day centre. It was one of the best at the time, very nice. I liked everything: the service, the staff, management… everything was very good. Staff was always kind and helpful… Even now they are looking after, but they don’t have enough time to spend after everyone, because the staff has been reduced. When I started I think there was…. I don’t remember exactly. I think it was 8 or 10. Now it is 5 or 6. I used to stay in the front part doing exercise and everything, but recently I stopped doing exercise. I’m now playing cards. I prefer exercise but I had to stop because of my health. It was chair based exercise and yoga. I have been to parties but I haven’t been to trips. Because of my health I didn’t go to trips. SubCo parties are very nice when I started coming here, but, slowly slowly, the situation got lower. After the government stopped the subsidy. Until then it was very nice…. I was singing songs once or twice at the parties, but I won’t give you a demonstration now!... I would recommend SubCo. In my opinion it is the best place and has the best services. Comparing that time and now, it’s a little bit low, but it’s still better. They cannot manage because of shortage of staff. They reduced the staff to cut expenses, so they cannot look after all at the same time… So many people, meeting with them, helps loneliness… I think there needs to be more staff, this is a flaw. The one thing I don’t like, when I started there were two minibuses. On one round they took all the people at half 9, and leave by half 3. Now they are small cars. They take people at 9 oclock. Sometimes they come at half 10, quarter to 11, and they start sending home at 1 o clock. The day is too short. If you come at half ten and go at one o clock, two o clock, that is too short. It says that the time is 9:30 – 3:30. I did ask one of your staff, once I asked her, ‘What’s your rule of the SubCo day centre? What time you start and what time you finish?’ 9:30-3:30. I said, ‘Can you give me in writing?’ She said, ‘Yes we can give you in writing’. I had an argument with her that this is not good because you cut the time of services. 10:30, quarter to 11, you start sending home at one o clock, so you cut the hours of your services… It is a good idea to record SubCo’s history. From these ideas you can try to improve… The building has improved. It has extended and become better. The room next to the dining room, the TV area, has been extended. After playing cards I watch telly.</p>
