<p><em>Okay, so it’s the 3<sup>rd</sup> of May, and I’m inter-interviewing Jabeer Butt as part of the SubCo project at his office, which is Race Foundation, in Kentish Town. Would you mind giving me your date of birth please, jabeer?</em></p>
<p>It’s 26 June, 1963.</p>
<p><em>And where were you born?</em></p>
<p>Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Is that… Presumably that’s where you were living at the time with you family.</em></p>
<p>Er, yes, yes. Erm, both my grandfathers, er, moved to, to East Africa back in the 1920s, and, eventually, the rest of the families followed them as well. So, erm, by 1948, not only were my grandparents there, the majority of their children were there as well. And my parents got married in, in Uganda, and, er, that’s where, where all except one of us were born as well.</p>
<p><em>Do you know what brought your grandparents to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Erm, it was a British colony at the time, and, er, erm, Britain had started to build, er, a railway line connecting various parts of East Africa together—Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and so on—and to build the railway line they brought over a huge number of Indian workers. And both my grandfathers were, were tailors, and went along, essentially, to service the, the new communities that were being formed in East Africa.</p>
<p><em>Wow. Erm, how old were you, sort of, before you left Uganda. I mean, do you have any memories growing up there?</em></p>
<p>I left two days after my ninth birthday [Laughs] so we were, we were moved here on the, er, 28<sup>th</sup> of June, 1972, and then… [Pause] Erm, obviously some memories are mine are all in terms of going to, er, growing up and going to school there. Erm, some memories I suspect are the result of people talking about what happened at this time, and what happened at that time, whether or not, er, I could remember them in, on my own, I’m not sure, but I’m… Erm…</p>
<p><em>What was the experience like of leaving the sort of country where your born and traveling to somewhere completely different?</em></p>
<p>Oh! I dreaded the prospect. Erm, so… [Pause] it was partly not only the unknown, but what we did know about, about, about England and, and the United Kingdom wasn’t something that, erm, necessarily appealed. We’re going to come from an extremely warm country, to [Laughs]…</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>… what appeared to be an extremely cold country and so on, so, erm…</p>
<p><em>Apart from the climate were there any other sort of big differences you noticed when you came here?</em></p>
<p>Well it was hugely different. I remember being, er, treated as a fifth class citizen. Not even second class, but… Was, er, experience literally from day one, so, erm…</p>
<p><em>Where, where did you settle?</em></p>
<p>Erm, Walthamstow.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. </em></p>
<p>Erm, so I was in Walthamstow up until the age of seventeen, and then we moved to, to Tottenham before I then went of to u-university, so…</p>
<p><em>What was it like growing up under a sort of cloud of racism?</em></p>
<p>Clearly in a, we were very lucky that, er, not only was my family there, but lots of my relatives were there as well, so, erm… It was a comparatively enjoyable, er, time, because, you know, we were able to establish that. However, it was, it was clearly tainted by the experience of, of, of racism, erm… Not least in the, impact that it had on, on, on the family circumstances, erm… My father worked in, er, in British Plastics, often having to work two shifts a day to, just about, earn enough [Laughs] to put food on the table and, erm… Erm, education was always a challenge and so on, but… [Pause] And then life in Walthamstow was… Even though there’s such a large minority community there, it was always, always a challenge. The regularity with which the National Front and various skinheads and so on saw it as their stamping ground was, was, er, [Pause] extraordinary. And, and you knew not, not to go to certain places. So you never went to Chingford [Laughs]; you never went to Leytonstone even though there was still a part of Waltham Forest, er... And there were very clear reasons why you never went to Chingford and you never went to Leytonstone, erm… Comparatively dangerous.</p>
<p><em>MmmHmm. Erm, where di you go to university?</em></p>
<p>Manchester. Manchester Polytechnic.</p>
<p><em>What was that experience like?</em></p>
<p>It was good. It was good. Erm, Manchester… I arrived the September after the 1981 riots, so loads of the places that I lived in had been impacted by the, by the riots and so on. Erm, so in a… Very close to where I lived for a year was still being… They were still clearing up, erm, the debris from the riots, so, erm…</p>
<p><em>What were the riots about?</em></p>
<p>It was the what are now known as the ‘Race Riots’ of 1981, where people in Moss Side, in various parts of London (including Waltham-Walthamstow, Brixton, er…), St Anns in Nottingham, erm, er, Chapeltown in Leeds and so on, all started to riot at the, mainly at the treatment of Black and Minority Ethnic communities. It happened not so long after, er, er, a Bangladeshi family in Walthamstow also died as a result of a fire that’d been started. Er, while the culprits were never caught (I don’t think were ever caught) there was always this suspicion that it was a racially motivated fire as well, so…</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>So a very difficult time. Clearly it was also the height of Thatcher’s attack on, on many of the safeguards that, erm, people had come to expect, and so unemployment had started to shoot through the roof, and a number of the safety nets that were meant to be there were being pulled away.</p>
<p><em>MmmHmm. Sounds like quite a challenging period in many respects.</em></p>
<p>It was. It was. It was. Erm…</p>
<p><em>Did you enjoy your, sort of, university time?</em></p>
<p>It was very good. I had, I had a whale of a time. Those were the days we still had grants…</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>… so we weren’t, erm, engaged in the level of debt that the present day students are. And being in Manchester, which was—in comparison to London and other places—was a comparatively cheap place to live, erm, meant that, you know, the grant did stretch to having a reasonable life, so… It was good. Yeah, good.</p>
<p><em>Erm, what were you studying?</em></p>
<p>I did, er, historical studies at, er, Manchester, which was (Manchester Polytechnic) which was, er, a degree that was, er, taught in collaboration with English Department, so there were twenty of us doing history, and there were twenty of us doing English, but we would regularly, er, have joint, joint sessions.</p>
<p><em>So after, after finishing at university, what did you go on to do, er, sort of immediately afterwards?</em></p>
<p>I secured a ESRC grant to do a PhD at Manchester University, as opposed to Manchester Polytechnic. Erm… [Pause] And towards the end of that I secured a job, a research job, in London.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>Started, started working.</p>
<p><em>What area did you move back in London?</em></p>
<p>I came back to Tottenham, but the work was in Hounslow, so from one end of London…</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>… to the other end on a daily basis, so a challenge.</p>
<p><em>What was your, sort of, research involved in?</em></p>
<p>It was looking at, er, at the experience of racial harassment in, in Hounslow. Erm, there had been a whole set of issues in the run up to the, to the work taking place, not least in that there were a number of estates in, in, er, in Hounslow that were, were very problematic, and were hotbeds of racial harassment and really… A number of voluntary groups were trying to work out what could be done better. So that was what…</p>
<p><em>Was lots of the work that was taking place sort of voluntary, or was there kind of broader government involvement?</em></p>
<p>Er, it varied in the, the local authority there was a labour run authority at that time, and they were supposedly supportive, erm, but, er, lots of the other statutory agencies either didn’t see it as an issue, or see it as a priority, so… The local police were [Pause] didn’t really pay much attention to it and so on, so…</p>
<p><em>Were you happy to be coming back to London from Manchester?</em></p>
<p>Not hugely so. I’ve never been a fan of London, although I’ve worked in London for, for, for many many years, er… Had, er [Pause]… More returning due to work than, than wanting to live here.</p>
<p><em>MmmHmm. Had it changed significantly when you were in, since when you were in Manchester, or sort of much the same?</em></p>
<p>Erm, er, I think there were, there had been some changes, but under it I suspect that those changes were taking place across the country. There’d been a dramatic rise of, erm, political participation among Black and Minority Ethnic communities, so we were not only voting, but we were actually becoming elected as councillors in particular. It was the rise of the black section in the labour party at the same time. It was, erm [Pause]… Obviously Scarman had been published in 1985, and supposedly government was trying to take action to, to respond to it as well, so, erm…</p>
<p><em>Was that a, sort of, report that came out?</em></p>
<p>Lord Scarman, because there were another set of, er, riots in 1985, and Lord Scarman was, er, asked to look into the causes of those, er, the riots, and he wrote, wrote a report that, erm, is a sort of key point in, in ,er, in the development of race relations in Britain. Lots of people talk about McPherson and the impact that McPherson, but Scarman was, I suspect, probably even more, er, important in what he did, certainly for local government and local government paying attention to issues to do with inequality. Erm, and importantly, Scarman reported at a time when, er, a Conservative government was still, er, at the peak of its, er, authority and so on. Yet he was able to persuade it sufficiently to certainly see some money being put into addressing issues to do with inequality.</p>
<p><em>MmmHmm.</em></p>
<p>And…</p>
<p><em>So, apart from that, there was more political engagement by the Black community.</em></p>
<p>Certainly was in a local, loc-, er, as I said, certainly in, er, you know, local government, local Labour, and many more people coming forward and standing for election, and thankfully many more people getting elected as well. Often men rather than women, but, you know, erm… It wasn’t the, the sea of white faces that, that there used to be in local government.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. As a Ugandan Asian, how did you see your place within the Black community (‘cos I mean that sort of idea of the ‘Black Community’ has changed quite a lot at the time)?</em></p>
<p>It, it constantly changes. Certainly my understanding of, of it was that I was part and parcel of that experience. Erm, I’ve not only experienced racism directly, but I understood how it was impacting the community as a whole, erm, so [Pause]… I think the, the challenge for, for me was that I, I, I wasn’t, er, sure that, er, the people on the left were, er, were addressing it, and addressing it any better than the people on the right, and therefore I was very reluctant to join any parties, erm…</p>
<p><em>What, erm, sort of aspect did your political engagement take?</em></p>
<p>Oh various things from, erm, regularly turning up to demonstrations, whether it was outside the, the South African embassy, or, or, or a whole set of other issues, erm… To certainly try to influence, erm, what was happening in local government.</p>
<p><em>So, I mean, that was around the mid-‘80s right, you said?</em></p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p><em>Sort of in the intervening period between then and the foundation of SubCo, what sort of work did you find yourself in?</em></p>
<p>Erm, as I say, I was a researcher and, er, once the Hounslow work finished, I got a job at Birmingham City Council. Was there for fifteen months as a researcher, then got a job at the National Institute for Social Workers and Researchers, erm… Eventualyl then moving to the [Coughs] the Foundation in its original form.</p>
<p><em>What, what sort of research did you carry out when in the Institute?</em></p>
<p>I was essentially looking at, er, erm, social services and, er, the provision of care to Black and Minority Ethnic communities. Erm, I carried out, er, a report. I’d done two studies: one was, er, er, postal survey of, or all social services departments in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland; erm, and the other was a more in-depth study of, er, which looked at three different types of authority, erm, to try and understand what work that we were doing and what was working. ‘Cos then in some senses we, we know why things don’t work. What’s more interesting is to understand why things do work, and whether or not that can be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>And, and that then built, built, built on with, with lots of other work over the years, so… Er, we carried out a study of, er, the use of family centres, which was the frist time, er, any attempt had been made to understand how family support was impacting Black and Minority Ethnic communities. Erm, we followed that up with work looking at, er, young disabled Black and Minority Ethnic communit-, er, people, and their experience of independence and independent living, for the first time ever anybody had sort of looked at that group, and, er, published a hopefully very important study. That was very soon studied by the biggest study on, erm, quality of life for Black and Minority Ethnic older people funded by the ESRC, which ran from, erm, 1999 to, to 2003.</p>
<p><em>Wow. Was there, sort of, support from above for these, erm, initiatives?</em></p>
<p>What do you mean with that?</p>
<p><em>From a sort of broader political, erm…</em></p>
<p>It was variable. Erm, we were still operating within the context of a Conservative government that often denied the, that racial inequality, but, even if the accepted it existed, erm, were reluctant to take any, any initiatives to, to, to address it. Erm, having said that we were able to still carve out, erm, not only work, but also, erm, how, how things could change and work with the partners that were willing to work with us to bring about that, that change.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>Particularly at a, in, in local government, and, more latterly, with, with the health service.</p>
<p><em>So when you joined the Race Foundation, what sort of for was it in?</em></p>
<p>‘Race Equality Foudnation’.</p>
<p><em>Race Equality Foundation, sorry.</em></p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p><em>Wh-what, what form was the organisation in?</em></p>
<p>The, erm, it was part of the National Institute for Social Work at that time; w-we were called the REU, erm, to when I joined there were only three of us, erm, a chief executive, myself, and then Hannah, an administrator. Erm, and I did some of the, some of r-research work that I mentioned earlier to you was done at that time.</p>
<p><em>Where were your offices based?</em></p>
<p>We were in Mary Ward House, which is in, er, er, erm, just the other side of Euston, erm… Quite close to Woburn Place.</p>
<p><em>So how did your work, erm, with the Race Equality Foundation sort of bring you into contact with SubCo or what became SubCo?</em></p>
<p>We were, as I said, we were always interested in not only wasn’t working—erm, we documented that quite well—but what was working and why it was working. And, er, particular area of concern for us was what was happening to the aging population, erm, certainly back in 1991, the aging population in Black and Minority Ethnic communities was comparatively small. I think the census suggested that it was something like a hundred-and-sixty-, hundred-and-eighty-thousand people from the new commonwealth in Pakistan, or people who could be described as Black and Minority Ethnic who were over the age of over sixty. And very few of them were over the age of seventy. Erm, the majority of services, even at that time, were, were not being provided to that age group; they tended to be provided to people over the age of seventy and so on, so they were almost all essentially from Britain’s white communities, yet if you looked at, er, er, ill-health, levels of ill-health for that generation of older people it was an experience for a much younger age, so a number of studies (including our own work) showed that, you know, people finding challenges with daily living at the age of fifty-five that white older people were experiencing at sixty-five and over. Erm, and that pattern’s repeated across the world with migrants, you know, and that, that… The process of migration itself has a weathering impact, so ill-health in later life is much higher. But, also, the experience of discrimination compounds that, that process of migration. Erm, we were struggling to, to find examples of any services that worked. So one study that I did, I talked to people in Nottingham… And anyway, we came across an older Caribbean man who, who had had two strokes, and the second stroke had left him so incapacitated that his elderly wife couldn’t look after him at home, and he ended up in residential care on discharge from hospital, and after two days of being in the residential home he said to, erm, his social worker that he need-, he wanted to go home, and she asked him why, and he said, ‘Well, I’d rather be dead at home than spend another day here.’ And, while that might be in some eyes seen as an extreme example, the example I met throughout, that the supportive services that were meant to be there—such as residential care, such as home care—weren’t really reaching out to Black and Ethnic Minority communities. So, even simple straightforward things, such as the provision of, er, erm, meals, er, that were, erm, either culturally or religiously appropriate… Many places struggled to, erm, either provide them, or just didn’t think that it was necessary to do. So when you came across organisations such as SubCo and what SubCo were trying to do in the day centre, and, er, how they were operating and so on… Erm, it was important for us to understand whether it was working, and, if it was working, what was it doing that was good. Erm, er, so we spent, er, erm, a lot of time with Taskin and colleagues over the years, as well as talking to a number of service users over the years as well, who not only helped us understanding what worked and why it worked, but then also helped us with other things as well. So, the quality of life study that we did in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s, er, the pilot work was done with, er, older people from SubCo. We ran through the questionnaires with them, and revised them accordingly and so on. Erm, some of the actual interviews in the end were done with, done with people from SubCo as well, so…</p>
<p><em>So did your research take the form of, sort of, going in and visiting the day centre, and talking to…?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Erm, I recall being there at least five or six occasions, er, erm… it got to the point where, er, a couple of people, I recognising knew regularly, er… my sister used to live round the corner from, from SubCo as well, and, on a number of occasions would be there on a Saturday, and I’d see her as well. Erm, and then importantly, er, lots of things started to change, and, er, and the way services were being commissioned was changing, you know, SubCo was going to be moved from receiving a grant to having to compete for contracts and so on. And we had lots of those discussions with them as well as the how they were going to manage that, and how they were going to cope and so on.</p>
<p><em>There must’ve been quite a lot of worry, presumably, with such a change.</em></p>
<p>It was a hugely, hugely problematic, er, occurrence, not the least because the, erm, the majority of commissioners hadn’t thought through the implications of what they were doing. Erm, a key driver for, erm, the, the commissioning process was to cut costs, and one of the way that lots of people assumed was to cut costs was to, erm, er, er, issued contracts that were of scale, therefore, you know, if, if you delivered a large contract there would be economies you could make. Now, erm, providing, er, day care to, to two-thousand people, erm, is not something that SubCo could do on its own, so it, for it to compete with some of the contracts that may’ve been issued would’ve been an impossibility, not least that they would’ve never been able to, erm, er, meet the, er, the, er five actual criteria. It was, er, a comparatively small organisation; no local authority would take the risk of awarding a huge contract to an agency that has no track record of, of delivering at that scale. Erm, but commissioners hadn’t thought it through at all; their view was that, anyway, we’re here to get value for money for, for the local authority. Erm…</p>
<p><em>So how did that impact SubCo’s provision?</em></p>
<p>There wasn’t… I think they got to a point where it was actually very difficult. And I think if it hadn’t, from my memory, if it hadn’t been for them securing lottery money and so on it would’ve been, er, very difficult for them, for SubCo to, to have survived. I might be misrepresenting the situation, but it was certainly my memory of, of, er, how things were going with that, er… There was a period where it was very, very difficult.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>Er, but then it was very difficult for lot, lots of organisations, and there was very little recognition that, not only the unique nature of their provision, but also the catalytic impact of their provision. Erm…</p>
<p><em>Could you explain what you mean by that a little more please?</em></p>
<p>Well in lots of mainstream services, they had a one size fits all approach: ‘This is what we do’, erm, ‘And it doesn’t matter if you’re six foot tall, or four foot tall, you have to fit in to what we do.’ Erm, and if you don’t fit in then, there was, really, often a suggestion that, actually, it was your fault, rather than our service not being good enough, or our service not meeting your needs. Whereas SubCo and another of others were able to demonstrate how much you could do differently, and not only differently you could do it well. And therefore the, the ability for mainstream providers to say, well, erm, you know, ‘We’re doing a good enough job!’ was challenged: ‘Actually you’re not doing a good enough job! There are other ways of doing it.’ Equally, if you don’t do it better, people will vote with their feet and go, go elsewhere, I suppose.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>I think there was, there was… it acted like there was a bit of a catalyst as well, erm…</p>
<p><em>So did…</em></p>
<p>And, certainly, one of the things we did, we, we, we produced a, er, practice guide on working better with, er, Black and Minority Ethnic older people in the very early years of the labour government, I think in 1999, and that was, had some, you know, involvement in it, and, gave prominence to what SubCo were doing and how they were doing it. So lots of people after we—in London but also elsewhere—saw that, actually, you could do things differently.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. Did, erm, the sort of change from Conservative to Labour government make things any easier, or was it still…</em></p>
<p>Certainly I think, er, there was more money available, you know, not necessarily it was certainly available to address inequality, er, or racial inequality should I say, erm… Too often the focus was on, on socio-economic inequality. And I think some, some in Labour, and I think it’s true to this day that, actually, if you address socio-economic inequality, all the other inequalities will be addressed as well, whereas the, the experience across the world is that, actually that’s not the case. While social, socio-economic inequality does have an impact, erm, without specifically addressing racism, er, you may well find that, erm, it not only persists, but things may get worse, and the ‘Breaking the Cycle’ report in, in 2006, which looked at all the various initiatives that Labour had taken, particularly area-based initiatives, such as the ‘New Communities’ programme and so on, while it had had an impact in addressing socio-economic inequality, there were particular groups that hadn’t benefitted, or certainly hadn’t benefitted to the extent that they should’ve done, and Black and Minority Ethnic communities was one of the ones that they identified, and, er, erm, not, not, not benefitted. Erm, and then, you know, we’d always argued that, you know, you needed both: you needed the general approach, but you needed the specific approach as well because that was the way to, to, to bring about change.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>So yes, there was more money in the, in the ‘00s, but, erm, there, it was still a struggle to, to focus on racial inequality. And people often talk about, you kow, the golden era with the publication of McPherson, and Race Relations Amendment Act of 2000 and so on, but, but I’m not, I’m not sure it was necessarily a golden era, erm… I think the challenges XXXX [00:33:49] slightly different XXXX [00:33:52] with, er, erm, erm, with some ministers, erm, the, the battle was still as, as, as challenging as others. David Blunkett never, never saw racial inequality as being a key issue, erm, therefore when he took a role at the Home Office, when he was Health Minister and so on, it was always a challenge to get him to pay attention.</p>
<p><em>Would you mind explaining a bit more about the context and detail of the McPherson Report, please?</em></p>
<p>Oh, McPherson was the inquiry launched by, by the newly arriving Labour government into the death of Stephen Lawrence, which tried to look at, er, why nobody’d been, er, convicted as a, as a result of the investigation. And McPherson reported not only into the investigation, but also the, the culture that was prevalent in, in the Metropolitan Police. Erm, and it gave a definition to ‘institutional racism’, which actually was around before then as well, erm… But, erm, it appearing in a government report and Jack Straw’s response from the Home Office, not only accepting elements of the report, but launching the bill that eventually led to the Race Relations Amendment Act, erm, gave, er, er, legislative force to, erm, to a new focus on, on racial inequality.</p>
<p><em>Erm, just to back-track a bit, did you have any sort of first impressions from when you went to SubCo?</em></p>
<p>Erm, the challenge with all small organisations was the, the level of demand in the, the ability to actually meet, meet, meet the need as a day care centre. That’s what I experienced was, er, you know, clearly very, erm, very well used, and people being very responsive. There were other challenges of whether or not, er, the Muslim comm-, the local Muslim community, the local Hindu community got on well enough, and the local Sikh community got on well enough to all being attending the same, the same centre. But they seemed to manage it. Erm, it seemed to, seemed to work. Erm, it was a, er, erm, very small centre, and, and you consider the size of the Asian community in and around Green Street, it was, erm, you did wonder whether it was big enough to meet the needs of the local community, though [Inaudible – fault in recording] was well used while, while we visited it.</p>
<p><em>Did the scale, sort of, allow a more personal approach which helped in their provision, do you think, or was it…?</em></p>
<p>It may. It may have had that effect. Er, there’s always a tension, isn’t there, between whether or not it’s, it’s the actual, er, workers who create that, or whether or not it’s, er, the, the institution itself. Erm, erm, certainly wh9le we were visiting SubCo, it had some, some very good workers who clearly had a very strong rapport with the, erm, their staff… their service users. Erm, and you’d hope that’s an indication of how the organisation is operation, not just, just the individuals it employs.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.Do you remember what sort of particular intitatives they were working on at that period?</em></p>
<p>Erm, I, as I said, the thing that I had most experience of was, was the day-care service they were providing, particularly the luncheon club and its use. I remember turning up often just before the lunch club was about to happen, or just after it had happened [Laughs] so you know, clear, clearly very well used. Erm, clearly very well… And as I said, we ran the pilot of our quality of life, so we were with a number of, er, people, who used the service as well, so that gave us an opportunity to talk to them about what they did and didn’t get, erm, from the service. And one of the uissues was about the social support, particularly from other older people, erm, because I think, er, one of the issues that emerges and emerged from our our biggest service was that, er, while lots of older people, particularly from the Asian community, lived with, erm, with family members, erm, there was a sense that, er, the tension, that what thhe families were doing was meeting their physical needs rather than necessarily meeting their emotional needs, and therefore there was certainly a sense of isolation and loneliness. SubCo not only provided the opportunity to have a good meal and so on, but to meet other people in similar situations. And we know that’s, that’s a key driver to well-being in lots of people’s lives.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Was there sort of attention being payed to isolation and loneliness back then, because it, it seems like, in the current climate, that’s a, a bit of a hot topic at the moment? </em></p>
<p>Yeah. Er, we, we… What’s that phrase? ‘Every generation rewrites, er, history in its own image’. We rewrite phrases as well, you know? Sadly describe, described loneliness. I don’t doubt works that’s now taking place on loneliness and its impact on the brain, and on your, and on your physical health is, is actually groundbreaking and has given us a new, nerw undesranding on the value of, of social support, erm, however that shouldn’t get us away from the fact that we, we’ve known for a very long time that, er, people who are isolated have poorer health, erm, and have various poorer incomes including, erm, lower life expectancy and so on. Erm, so, certainly, social isolation was, was very well renknowned and a key issue in why people wanted to come to centres when they were having meals delivered to them at home. Not to say that that wasn’t, wasn’t still being done, but the value of centres was, erm, was keenly recognised in, in SubCo, but also by, by many others.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. Erm,I think you mentioned your sister lived close to the centre; were you, had you sort of been to the area before you worked there?</em></p>
<p>Green Street is a… I never worked for SubCo…</p>
<p><em>Did your research there, sorry.</em></p>
<p>Erm, Green Street, er, certainly since the 1980s has become a very popular Asian shopping centre, and also I’d been going there for some years before I knew and got engaged with SubCo.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. Erm [Pause] what, what, erm, what as your relationship with the SubCo staff like through your period of research.</em></p>
<p>Well, I was trying to remember before you came, I was trying to remember. ‘cos I remember there being three people that we regularly engaged with. Taskin was one of them, and then there was an Asian woman and an Asian man, and for the life of me I can’t remember their names [Laughs] XXXX [00:42:49]. I was hoping that I’d, I’d remember before you came, but I, I still can’t. Erm, but they were always very supportive, er, of the work that we were doing, and hopefully they found that we were supportive of the work they were doing. Erm, whether or not it, er, it felt like that on their side is obviously a question that only they can answer. Erm, erm, but we were all very pleased with, with what they did for us, and the op-, opportunities they provided us to access some of their service users, and they still do to this day,</p>
<p><em>Erm, so what’s the ongoing work, then, that the Race Equality Foundation undertakes with SubCo?</em></p>
<p>Well, er, there’d been a couple of occasions of late that we’ve, we’ve tried to engage some of the older people in the work. We’re doing a lot of work around dementia now, and, er, I think it’s the, it’s a hopefully, erm, as, as the community’s have aged, and as SubCo has started to recognise that as an issue as well, it’s, er, it’s something we’ll carryon, carry on working with. The issue of personalisation keeps coming up, and how personalisation is actually an impact on… How it’s working with Black and Ethnic Minority communities, it con-0, continues to be an issue, and I suspect SubCo is facing the same challenges that, that we are in trying to understand what works, and how we can do everything better.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. As well as, erm, sort of increasing attention to dementia, what other service needs have changed in the, sort of, older Asian community?</em></p>
<p>Er, I think, er, what’s clear is that, er, those communities that arrived in, in post Second World War, and up to the early-1970s, are, er, seeing significant change; one of which is that, er, erm, the suburbanisation of minority communities is taking place. XXXX [00:44:56] er, younger generations are moving into out further afield from where the original settlements were. The place I know best, Walthamstow, is now seeing people moving to places like Chingford and Leytonstone, and Woodford Green and so on: places that, certainly when I was wrong, would’ve never considered to be, er, appropriate, or, or, that’s happened. But what seems to also be occurring is that the older generation, that, when the people all arrived then lived in the first instance continued to live in those areas. So there are a lot still in Walthamstow, still around Green Street. And there’s a change taking place, that there aren’t as many young people living with, with older people, and I think that we’re, we’re minority communities from within that census evidence are developing very similar patterns. So, while there aren’t a huge number of minority people over the age of eighty-five, those that are have a very similar living arrangements to their white counterparts: they’re more likely to be living in pensioner only households, and more so they’re more likely to be just living on their own as well, erm, which is very similar to their white counterparts. And we know that those people, pensioner only households and people living on their own, are the ones often most in need of support, as it were. Erm, so and I think that’s, that’s true, increasingly true of minority communities as well. The one chang-, difference in London is that, erm, London is experiencing a huge housing crisis, and, erm, which is, erm, er, forcing more and more people to try and live in less and less space. And whether or not that means we’ll see arising multi-generational households I’m not sure; it’s certainly something we’re investigating at the moment with a colleague of ours from Coventry university analysing the census data again to try and understand XXXX [00:47:08] er, household formation. But as I said, up until, erm, erm, certainly even, er, 2010, there was a move towards suburbanisation. But it meant, also, that older people were being left in the areas that they’d originally settled in.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>Erm, and that may have been leading to greater experience of isolation and…</p>
<p><em>Er, I don’t think I have any more questions, so if you have anything else that you’d like to share, or that you think is relevant, or any further memories of SubCo…</em></p>
<p>Obviously I’ve not talked about eating the food there [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>It was always, the valuable thing was even when you heard some very distrwessing stories, and certainly I remember talking to one very old woman whose family life was very problematic, and the treatment at the hands of her son were, were, deeply depressing, erm, XXXX [00:48:28] also had the opportunity to then watch them all, er, having their lunch and so on, and the lifting effect that that had on everybody’s spirits was, was valuable and worth remember.</p>
<p><em>Was the food good at the centre?</em></p>
<p>Er, it always was, it always was! [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] </em></p>
<p>It always was.</p>
<p><em>Excellent.</em></p>
<p>Freshly made and so on, so it was always good.</p>
<p><em>Excellent, well, erm, thank you for your time, Jabeer, it’s been really interesting talking to you.</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
