<p>Right, I’ve got two lots, two sets of photographs, one set are before the hit and the other set when the, the riot police and the squad came to evict the people and to, and then, Claremont Road was demolished and</p>
<p><em>Can I just stop you for a second, I’m really sorry, can I just ask you to say your name for me before </em></p>
<p>Maureen Measure and my, I’m Maureen Measure and I’ve lived near Claremont Road for many years</p>
<p><em>And can you spell your name for me as well</em></p>
<p>M-E-A-S-U-R-E as in tape, measure</p>
<p><em>Fantastic, thank you and one more thing, can you just tell me the year of your birth if you’re happy to do that</em></p>
<p>Nineteen forty one</p>
<p><em>Fantastic</em></p>
<p>I’m seventy four now</p>
<p><em>Excellent, thank you very much. Ok and we’re just starting by looking at some photographs</em></p>
<p>Looking at the photographs which I took, um, I think it was about nineteen ninety, but it’s in the article, the actual date, and I was walking home from the swimming pool and I saw that Claremont Road which is, was being decorated, so the next few days, next few months, I went and took some photographs and these are some of the decorations on Claremont Road</p>
<p><em>Ah, that’s so beautiful…amazing colours</em></p>
<p>They decorated the whole terrace of houses…is in that one, well there’s a coffin there, filled with flowers</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] And what does it say on here, can we read, can you read</em></p>
<p>It says</p>
<p><em>It looks like it says maybe imagine a place</em></p>
<p>As</p>
<p><em>As</em></p>
<p>Homes I think, woodlands</p>
<p><em>As woods</em></p>
<p>Homes</p>
<p><em>Woods and homes? That</em></p>
<p>Could be, yes…this is a treehouse that the protesters went up in to protest and this is the Central Line here</p>
<p><em>So we’re still on Claremont Road?</em></p>
<p>Still on Claremont Road, mmm….</p>
<p><em>Excellent</em></p>
<p>These are some of the protesters</p>
<p><em>Did you know any of them?</em></p>
<p>I knew some of them, Bundy, Bundy her name is, her name is Bundy</p>
<p><em>Lovely, and then this is the, I’ve seen pictures of this, this kind of henge, brick henge</em></p>
<p>Yes, it’s a kind of sculpture</p>
<p><em>Yeah, lovely</em></p>
<p>Here is some more street paintings, here is the Central line here, at this point of the street there’s a tent</p>
<p><em>A very nice camo, kind of bell tent</em></p>
<p>Mmm, here’s some more</p>
<p><em>So was this one with the vines, the flowers painted, was that the art house or have I got that wrong?</em></p>
<p>I think the, we’ I don’t remember which was the art house but it was along there, one of the ones with a, one of the ones which the paint, flowers painted in a frieze, it’s this one</p>
<p><em>A row of beautiful horses</em></p>
<p>Here’s another one, this seems to be some sort of…I don’t, what do you call this, some sort of piano or organ there</p>
<p><em>Yeah, or, or like a pin, not a pinball machine, it looks like some kind of, almost like arcade game, or maybe it’s a musical instrument, I don’t know</em></p>
<p>Another one</p>
<p><em>So does this motif of the flowers go all along the whole road?</em></p>
<p>It went along fi’, seven or eight houses…here’s another one with the motif of the flowers and silhouette of a couple kissing and a silhouette of a cat</p>
<p><em>Hmm and homes not roads</em></p>
<p>Here we are again with the furniture in the street</p>
<p><em>No M eleven, no roads…I love these block colours all around the doors and windows</em></p>
<p>Here we are again with an iron ironing board empty fridge and I donated the lampshade</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Oh excellent, it’s like a whole house outside in the</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>The set up of a house along the, along the road…wonderful, and a bath with a mannequin in having a bath [laughs]</em></p>
<p>And it also says here, it says H two</p>
<p><em>H two S O four</em></p>
<p>That’s an acid I think it is</p>
<p><em>Oh [laughs]</em></p>
<p>Sulphuric acid</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Oh what’s happening here?</em></p>
<p>Well it’s, it’s a, it’s a sculpture of a gramophone needle</p>
<p><em>Oh, yeah or course it is</em></p>
<p>And the con’, in the concentric circles I suppose, to be the gramophone record</p>
<p><em>Of course, yeah</em></p>
<p>Here we have some people, and this was called effing, can I say it, fucking Mick who said fuck this fuck that fuck the other, you can cut that out if you like</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] No I won’t</em></p>
<p>Fucking Mick</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And he had a ginger cat and he lived at the end…and he</p>
<p><em>What was his, so you know what his cat was called?</em></p>
<p>Uh, I can’t remember but it, it, I was, it had a happy ending anyway</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] it’s really funny that you tell, that you say that because I’ve come across him lots and everywhere I come across him mentioned in articles and things he’s always called old Mick</em></p>
<p>Oh Fucking Mick</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] So it’s funny you saying he was actually called fucking Mick</em></p>
<p>This is where he used to live, at the very end there and he and his cat</p>
<p><em>No M eleven, excellent, and is this the rust in peace car?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I’ve got a picture of that, that’s where he, now this is the, my famous photograph of the rust in peace car</p>
<p><em>It’s the same on isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>And there it is</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Oh no this is another one</p>
<p><em>Oh is it another one?</em></p>
<p>It’s another one, this is rust in peace</p>
<p><em>That’s excellent, so that’s a picture, just for the tape, that’s a picture of a car with, um, things growing out of its bonnet and it says rust in peace on the side…beautiful</em></p>
<p>I’ve got another one</p>
<p><em>Amazing sculptures</em></p>
<p>And this is brilliant, that’s a sort of, stripy van, cut in half with the zebra [zeeebra rather than zebra] crossing in the middle</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>And there’s the Central line again</p>
<p><em>Excellent, so, shall I put those down there, are they</em></p>
<p>So</p>
<p><em>Are these</em></p>
<p>We’ve got as f’, ooo here’s another one, uh, um, before the hit</p>
<p><em>Oh that’s a very neat…brick, that sculpture…beautifully laid out spiral of bricks…and that’s a</em></p>
<p>And another one before the hit</p>
<p><em>Oh wow, this place as a wood homes or the m eleven, so the other poster must, so this whole thing must have been said together I imagine this place as a wood homes or the M eleven…mmm</em></p>
<p>Now this is a famous photograph, it’s called Claremont tower, they built it as a sort of superstructure on, half way along the terrace and people climbed up it to, to, just to be there and occupy it</p>
<p><em>Amazing, that’s a lovely photograph, did you take that photograph?</em></p>
<p>I took that one yeah, yes, I took most of, I took all of these</p>
<p><em>That’s really lovely, so when was that taken, was that</em></p>
<p>Uh, it was the day before the hit, I’ve got the, on my interview in here I, I’ll get the dates, I know it was a Monday and I think</p>
<p><em>On the, um, in your, in your article</em></p>
<p>In my article yes, I can’t remember the exact year, I’ll have a look</p>
<p><em>I should, I’ve got it, I’ve got it printed out here</em></p>
<p>There’s Claremont tower in there</p>
<p><em>Yeah, oh there’s that photo of, that’s that same photo isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>That’s the same one yeah</p>
<p><em>Um…swimming pool in the morning of, uh, Monday morning in the summer of nineteen ninety four</em></p>
<p>That’s when I took the first photographs of</p>
<p><em>That’s when you took the photos, oh and then the hit happened, that happened in November didn’t it?</em></p>
<p>November, Monday twenty eighth</p>
<p><em>Monday the twenty eight nineteen nin’</em></p>
<p>Nineteen ninety four, that was it, November twenty eight, you can see because it’s, the trees are bare</p>
<p><em>And so when did you write the article, I don’t, don’t have a date or anything</em></p>
<p>Oh about two, that was a couple of years ago</p>
<p><em>Couple of years ago</em></p>
<p>Two or three years ago…and then, um, I went down there one Monday morning and um, they said there’s going to be a, they were coming at, actually going to come and, r’ remove the protesters and then demolish the houses one morning, morning, so I was going back for something and I thought I’ll stay, and I sat at the end near fucking Mick’s house, I could see what’s going on, and the most extraordinary thing happened, the atmosphere was electric and, everybody started laughing cause the postman came along, I called it the last post [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Yeah you mentioned that in your article as well, so was he coming to deliver letters?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, just like anywhere else</p>
<p><em>Just like anywhere else</em></p>
<p>And then…I suddenly, the riot squad arrived, here, here come the riot squad</p>
<p><em>Wow</em></p>
<p>And I immediately rushed back into Claremont Road from the end and, the riot squad…I think they were based at the T A up by the Whips Cross Hospital…riot squad</p>
<p><em>Looks scary</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember his name, but he’s quite well known…you see all the protesters are, are getting up into the trees and on the Claremont tower and, and sitting on the rooves, except older people like myself who just sat on the floor</p>
<p><em>Very sensible…so was he a protester this guy that you’re saying was well known</em></p>
<p>Yes, he’s a protester, he’s, I’ve forgotten his name I’m afraid</p>
<p><em>You don’t know what he’s doing, is he recording or something, he looks like he’s…he’s holding a</em></p>
<p>I think he’s recording as well…here are some of the protesters on top of one of the houses</p>
<p><em>Oh they’re waving…lovely, so this is, this is all the day</em></p>
<p>This is on the day, everybody was making an awful noise, I just didn’t say a word, just kept quiet…this is just the general…pushing and shoving and</p>
<p><em>So what time did you arrive, do you know?</em></p>
<p>I think I got there about half past ten or so and the hit was about twelve o’clock and they closed the Central line as well I realised</p>
<p><em>Mmm…and was it, was the street easily accessible for the whole time, were people able to come and</em></p>
<p>Yes, people would come and go, yes, but there were two entrances into Claremont Road, people could come in and out, wasn’t blocked off by anybody, but the police actually came both ends, the riot squad, they, and met in the middle</p>
<p><em>And they weren’t stopping people from coming in?</em></p>
<p>No, they weren’t stopping people from coming in they could get, they could get in if you wanted to</p>
<p><em>Mmm, yeah cause there are lots of people aren’t there, it’s really crowded</em></p>
<p>All this is a bit confused, arms and legs and bodies and, you can see, this one you can see the, one of the, two of the riot squad with their helmets</p>
<p><em>Mmm…and lots of, yeah, spectators all jostling for space</em></p>
<p>Here are the protesters</p>
<p><em>A lovely one</em></p>
<p>Climbing up Claremont tower in the, overhead in the nets</p>
<p><em>So do you know what the nets were, what</em></p>
<p>I don’t know what they were made of but they were, must have been quite strong to have, to support those people</p>
<p><em>Mmm…and what does that say? Defy the criminal justice act and Claremont Road E eleven, say no to the M eleven link</em></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that’s a lovely picture</em></p>
<p>The same thing the Claremont tower and some protesters in the nets that were attached to the trees</p>
<p><em>Mmm…so were these trees all demolished as well</em></p>
<p>Yes, the trees came down, they were cut down after the houses, but they were cut down, unfortunately…this is, there’s the link road is there now xxxx</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>And a deep channel…then</p>
<p><em>More riot squad</em></p>
<p>Mmmhmm…and there’s a line of trees between Claremont Road and the, and the Central line and there were no houses opposite that one terrace of houses</p>
<p><em>So it was just one side</em></p>
<p>One side</p>
<p><em>And then, and then the trees and then the Central line was behind the trees</em></p>
<p>Yes, it was blocked off for traffic of course, no traffic could get along there, except bikes and, um, postmen walking</p>
<p><em>How, and how were the, how was it blocked off at either end?</em></p>
<p>With, all the furniture was there so nobody could drive along it, it was the beds and there was the wardrobes and the baths and the sculptures and</p>
<p><em>That’s amazing [laughs]…protesters being manhandled</em></p>
<p>Mmmhmm…some more of the, during the hit</p>
<p><em>Really gives an amazing sense of the place…these pictures</em></p>
<p>This is where effing Mick lived and, uh, above his house, you see, up there, the protesters</p>
<p>[Maureen’s husband Bill enters]</p>
<p>[Bill] England are all out for two hundred and eighty one Maureen</p>
<p>Oh right</p>
<p>[Bill] A hundred and forty five</p>
<p>Two hundred and eighty one, ok</p>
<p>[Bill] Yeah, a hundred and forty five in front</p>
<p>Mmm…another one of Claremont tower, an old one</p>
<p><em>An old one?</em></p>
<p>Um, well that was before they actually, when they were building it</p>
<p><em>Wha’, ok, yeah, so that was before the hit</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that was before the hit</p>
<p><em>Oh and there’s the…there’s the horses</em></p>
<p>Do you remember who this is Bill, she was the, she was the lady who did the cross, who, lollipop lady</p>
<p>[Bill] Oh yes</p>
<p>Can you remember her name</p>
<p>[Bill] Oh</p>
<p><em>Gene</em></p>
<p>Gene, Gene somebody, yep Gene, the lollipop lady</p>
<p>[Bill] Yes, sorry yeah</p>
<p><em>Gene, now I’m just trying to remember her surname, that was her is it?</em></p>
<p>That’s Gene yeah</p>
<p><em>Oh fantastic, I know people who would really like to talk to her…cause she nearly lost her job didn’t she?</em></p>
<p>And that’s the last one I took before the photographer was taken with one, lifted up well by four limbs and removed from Claremont Road, I just went limp and they didn’t take my camera and they left me outside</p>
<p><em>What was it like being carried away like that?</em></p>
<p>Well it was most odd but, but they didn’t, they were very gentle and I didn’t, I didn’t protest, I just lay there because if he told me, I’ve done the non-violent, um, action, direct action training N-V-D-A, you don’t resist, you just go</p>
<p><em>Mmm, and did you find it difficult to just go limp or did</em></p>
<p>No I just went limp</p>
<p><em>You just went limp</em></p>
<p>And I was silent, everybody else was screaming and screeching, the noise was terrible, but I just was silent and I said young man, y’ you know, this is wrong that I should be carried on like this and a, a middle aged lady, um they took me and left me outside and then I think it was difficult to get back, but some people stayed on until the Wednesday, and then they were all taken away, um, when, when they first came I was, also went to the café and there was a cat with four kittens, and before the hit somebody put them in a box and took them away…and the last resident of Claremont Road was effing Mick’s, fucking Mick’s cat because they’d all gone, but, and he wouldn’t have his, he was taken away, but he wouldn’t have his cat rehomed, so one of the security guards took him on, there were security guards there as well, so, one of them took on effing Mick’s cat</p>
<p><em>Aww that’s lovely, what happened to effing mick?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know, I, I haven’t heard, seen him for ages, have you heard from him Bill</p>
<p>[Bill] No, I haven’t no, uh, he was, uh</p>
<p>There was Dolly, Dolly was a lady who had lived in Claremont Road for ninety three years since she was born and she moved out a, a week or so before</p>
<p><em>Did you know her, did you</em></p>
<p>We knew her by, well yes Dolly, she…is there a, I don’t think there’s a photograph of Dolly Bill</p>
<p>[Bill] No, I don’t think there is</p>
<p>But I have…other photographs somewhere, which I can find</p>
<p><em>Are you</em></p>
<p>Sorry</p>
<p><em>No, no</em></p>
<p>Right…I have a photograph here on the computer of Dolly I think</p>
<p><em>Oh ok</em></p>
<p>We’re recording this Bill, but um</p>
<p><em>Oh yeah, we’re recording [laughs]</em></p>
<p>I might have, I can’t find that particular photograph it’s in black and white and I didn’t take it</p>
<p><em>So, just for the sake of the tape</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Bill, um, has joined us [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Laughs] And if you had to cut this down, you’ll cut out all of our chatter won’t you</p>
<p><em>I’ll cut, yeah, cut down the tape</em></p>
<p>Is this for eastside, London eastside community</p>
<p><em>Heritage</em></p>
<p>Heritage, I’ve got the book, but as for copyright, I didn’t want them just to go to there because everybody’s used these photographs</p>
<p><em>We’ll talk about that, but it’s absolutely fine</em></p>
<p>I’ll see if I can find…I’ve got a few of these</p>
<p>[Bill] That was a wonderful campaign we, made a lot of friends through that and, uh</p>
<p>These are just some of the’, some of them</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>[Bill] Ok, we ha’, at the end, we didn’t, we, but I</p>
<p>I don’t think they’re all there</p>
<p>[Bill] I think it’ll, I think it means that the department of transport are gonna think twice about anymore, um, motorways</p>
<p><em>Mmm, yeah absolutely…so were you very involved as well?</em></p>
<p>[Bill] Yeah, yeah</p>
<p>See if I can, oh this is what I’m looking for this, um…my article that’s, that’s the article I wrote</p>
<p><em>Yes</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s not the one I’m looking for, if I take a little time to find this, one I want…oh that’s Claremont the cat, we had a, we took on a cat from a friend who had been in Claremont Road and, um, she was Claremont, that’s her, um, unfortunately she died, but she’s, uh</p>
<p><em>She’s very pretty, was she a protesters cat then or was she a res’</em></p>
<p>Yes, she belonged to Jackie, oh Jackie she was one of the protesters and Jackie I’m afraid, Carpenter, she died, but she, had this cat and we took it on and it lived a very happy life</p>
<p>[Bill] She was a very intelligent cat</p>
<p>But what I’m trying to see Bill</p>
<p>[Bill] One of the most intelligent cats</p>
<p>Is a black and white photograph of the residents, I don’t know where it is</p>
<p>[Bill] Do you have animals?</p>
<p><em>Uh, no I don’t, I grew up with cats but, but I don’t have any at the moment, I would, I do like cats a lot though…I’m definitely a cat person, not a dog person [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Bill] Right, well, there’s always plenty around that are looking for a home</p>
<p><em>Yeah that’s true</em></p>
<p>Where’s that one I’m looking for, oh, that’s Claremont again, I’ll see if I can find it Bill, anyway</p>
<p><em>Well don’t, yeah, don’t worry now, for now</em></p>
<p>Oh this is Jackie Carpenter whose cat we took on, that was fur’, not Claremont Road that was further up</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] That’s a nice picture…that’s a picture of, Jackie whose a woman</em></p>
<p>That’s Jackie Carpenter whose</p>
<p><em>In her</em></p>
<p>Whose cat we took on and we called Claremont</p>
<p><em>And how old is she in this picture do you think?</em></p>
<p>Oh I don’, about seventy five seventy seven</p>
<p><em>She’s a woman whose about seventy five seventy seven and she’s wearing a</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately I can’t find that picture, that black and white picture of the people in Claremont Road, Bill, I can’t see it</p>
<p>[Bill] I can’t remember, I can’t help you</p>
<p><em>Don’t worry about it, don’t worry</em></p>
<p>Are you, you’re concentrating on Claremont Road aren’t you cause</p>
<p><em>No, not particularly, we’re not particularly focussed any more on Claremont Road than, um, just the whole campaign</em></p>
<p>The whole campaign?</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>[Bill] Jackie was very, erudite, um…she, she used to, read Latin as a hobby</p>
<p><em>Oh wow…she’s got a, for the sake of the tape, she’s got a placard round her that says criminal</em></p>
<p>Criminal yeah, do you remember that one Bill?</p>
<p><em>Question mark</em></p>
<p>I didn’t take that, I don’t know where, oh, maybe I did, I can’t remember</p>
<p>[Bill laughs]</p>
<p><em>She doesn’t look like a criminal [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Bill] Well you, you wouldn’t know would you [laughs]</p>
<p><em>I s’pose not [laughs] oh, oh there’s, look, there’s another one with somebody with the same placard round his</em></p>
<p>Yes these, these I didn’t take, I don’t know where they came from</p>
<p><em>These are more black and white</em></p>
<p>They’re more black and white…the one I’m looking for is a very good one and a pity I can’t find it, it’s in this box somewhere</p>
<p><em>Mmm…oh, blimey, that looks painful</em></p>
<p>[Bill laughs]</p>
<p><em>Somebody entangled in, barbed wire on the top of a fence</em></p>
<p>Some of these are other things, but</p>
<p><em>Are these, I know you didn’t take them, but are they still M eleven</em></p>
<p>They’re still M eleven, yeah</p>
<p><em>So is that George green?</em></p>
<p>Geo’ yes, no George green, there was a, there’s another main campaign, there was a chestnut tree which became quite famous and was occupied by people and was in, in the way of the motorway and eventually it was cut down…this was the other big protest</p>
<p><em>Do you have</em></p>
<p>I’ve got photographs of that</p>
<p><em>So is that Claremont tower again?</em></p>
<p>That’s Claremont tower yeah</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>These are photographs of…the chestnut tree on George green, that was, that was, um, cut down cause it was in the way of the motorway</p>
<p><em>Hmm, that’s a good one</em></p>
<p>And it was cut down</p>
<p><em>Oh wow and these are pictures of it actually, after it was cut down…and it’s still covered in, kind of, dressings and tinsel and R-I-P tree…aww</em></p>
<p>There’s numerous photographs of Filibrook Road, where there was another row of large houses that were demolished and they were also occupied…cause some people were paid compensation to leave their houses and when they left the houses, the protesters moved in</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm…so was Fillibrook Road another, kind of, protest site was that</em></p>
<p>Yes it was, if you turn right as you come out of, out of Leytonstone station, the right hand exit and turn right, that, there were, there’s Fillibrook Road, which still is Fillibrook Road, no it isn’t it’s called something else because they knocked down, all the houses, they knocked down half the houses, the ones on the Central line, large Victorian, huge mansions, they knocked them all down that side…and they all, they were also occupied, people were carried off if they, when the riot squad arrived</p>
<p><em>And there’s effing Mick’s house there</em></p>
<p>And this was one of the houses</p>
<p><em>Motorway madness…roads are bad for the issues of, for the issues of your, hmm, I can’t read that…is this, uh, where was this, do you know where this was?</em></p>
<p>Is that one in Fillibrook Road, as you, I’ll tell you, I’ve got the A to Z here I think, I’ll show you where it was</p>
<p><em>Mmm, that would be great</em></p>
<p>Oh these letters here, I was looking for something else</p>
<p><em>So this is a picture I’m looking at on the front of the Independent magazine from the twentieth of May nineteen ninety five</em></p>
<p>Yep</p>
<p><em>Motorway madness</em></p>
<p>Do you want to borrow any of these, are you ok?</p>
<p><em>Well I, uh, I might, love to if, but we can talk about that afterwards, it would be, potentially</em></p>
<p>Well I, the other thing I could do is I could scan them and send them as a photograph</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that would be</em></p>
<p>I’ve got, I’ve got some on the screen, but not all of them</p>
<p><em>Cause, well, we have, we only have a digital archive anyway, so we, so if I were, if you, if I were to take any, it would just be a case of us scanning them, but we e’, either we could do that to save you time? Or you could do it, if you didn’t want to, kind of let them out of your sight which would be completely understandable</em></p>
<p>[Bill] We can do that can’t we Maureen</p>
<p>We can do it, we can s’, whatever you, if you like them just, I’ll, I’ll email them to you, I’ll scan them and email them</p>
<p><em>That would be wonderful</em></p>
<p>Actually one by one cause otherwise it takes ages and ages</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] So this is</em></p>
<p>Now this, this is, this is, this used to be Fillibrook Road here and there’s still, there’s a bit…of Fillibrook Road here</p>
<p><em>Oh yeah</em></p>
<p>That’s all that left of Fillibrook Road, the little bit and this was Fillibrook Road all the way up here to where the bridge is where that’s, well that’s where those large houses were</p>
<p><em>So, so what is now Grove Green Road used to be Fillibrook Road?</em></p>
<p>No, Grove Green Road was always there</p>
<p><em>Yeah that’s what I thought</em></p>
<p>But Fillibrook Road used to run</p>
<p><em>Oh it used to run alongside</em></p>
<p>Along Grove, it used, uh, from Grove Green Road it used to go</p>
<p><em>I see</em></p>
<p>Fillibrook Road used to go along here, and it’s now Kingswood Road</p>
<p><em>Mmmhmm</em></p>
<p>And it went up as far as there and this side where the A twelve is now, the m eleven link, this is where the large houses are, one of which is those</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>And, and I, am I right in thinking that this is, that this house was called Monstoneia</em></p>
<p>Wanstonia?</p>
<p><em>M-onstonia</em></p>
<p>I think there was, no, there was one in Wanstead called Wanstonia, they had a republic of Wanstonia and there was a big house there and that was Wanstonia, they declared themselves and independent republic…I think that’s all I’ve got of those</p>
<p><em>Um, you’ve got lots of things</em></p>
<p>Well we had a newsletter called the r’, the roadbreaker…and that was, um…produced</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I’ve seen some of</em></p>
<p>[Bill] That was produced by Colin Becks</p>
<p>Colin Becks? Oh Colin Becks, yeah, what happened to him?</p>
<p>[Bill] Don’t know</p>
<p>He was a bit, um, he was a bit paranoia wasn’t he?</p>
<p>[Bill] Yeah</p>
<p>He thought there were…spies…spying on him</p>
<p>[Bill] Haven’t heard, about him for ages</p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>[Bill] And, haven’t heard from Henry either</p>
<p>Henry, no, no I haven’t, well this is some years ago now Bill and effing Mick, haven’t heard from him…I don’t know what happened to Bundy…and Jackie died…but we still know Jennifer and the others don’t we</p>
<p>[Bill] Oh yeah</p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>So that’s amazing</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Ummm, thank you so much for showing me those pictures, can I, are you happy for us to do a kind of a more formal talky…</em></p>
<p>Ok, ok</p>
<p><em>…talky thing, talking interview, is that…</em></p>
<p>Ok, right</p>
<p><em>[laughs] I mean, when I say formal, I don’t mean really formal, I just mean… if I, I’ll ask you more questions now</em></p>
<p>Oh if you, if you if you like. I can remember the date now it was 1994, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>[Bill] I’ll move out ‘cos I won’t get a word in edgeways</strong></p>
<p><em>[laughs] Well it’s entirely up to you, you’re welcome to stay but… if you [laughs]… go and watch the cricket, that’s absolutely fine [laughs]</em></p>
<p>Right ok, and if I find that I’ve a photograph, I’ll email it to you because it’s somewhere around, it’s a black and white one giving the residents of Claremont Road, which I didn’t take</p>
<p><em>Fantastic…Ok, so we’ve already done your name and your date of birth, so that’s brilliant, so we can we, can we just start off, can you just start off by telling me a little bit, telling me where you were born?</em></p>
<p>Oh, I was born in Hampshire, near Basingstoke and we moved around quite a bit when I was a kid</p>
<p><em>Umm, why did you move around?</em></p>
<p>Well my father had a reserved occupation managing farms, it was during the war</p>
<p><em>Ahhh</em></p>
<p>So we moved to four or five places, before I was five</p>
<p><em>Oh wow, all around the same…</em></p>
<p>Hampshire… and… Devonshire, North and South Hampshire and Devonshire we lived</p>
<p><em>So did you have strong memories of growing up on farms?</em></p>
<p>I xxxx the farms were… one of the farms, I only remember one of the farms, because I was too young, but we lived in a place called [Burghclere?] and my father used to walk to work every morning, and that’s the place I.. always thought of as home because we moved around such a lot I always think that was home, and then we moved to London</p>
<p><em>How old…</em></p>
<p>Then we moved to Kent, and then we moved to London, when I was 16 and then we stayed in London</p>
<p><em>And, umm was your mum… was your mother around as well?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes she as around</p>
<p><em>And what was she doing?</em></p>
<p>Nothing</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>She did nothing my mother, she was... she did, she hadn’t worked since she was married, she didn’t do any housework, she managed sometimes to pay people to do for her. My mother did nothing, except grumble about her health</p>
<p><em>Was she unwell?</em></p>
<p>Not very unwell, but she was k… the neighbours called her the creaking gate, she grumbled about her health morning, noon and night</p>
<p><em>Wow…[laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Laughs]</p>
<p><em>The creaking gate</em></p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
<p><em>Did you call her that as well? [laughs]</em></p>
<p>No, I just I…</p>
<p><em>Ummm… and so you were 16 when you moved to…</em></p>
<p>Earl’s Court</p>
<p><em>Earl’s Court?</em></p>
<p>West London</p>
<p><em>And what are your… can you tell me any early memories you’ve got of, of Earl’s Court?</em></p>
<p>I loved it, interesting vibrant place to be</p>
<p><em>Ermm… can you tell me anymore, can you, what can you remember, do you have any particular memories of the place?</em></p>
<p>Umm, we lived in a small, in a small road, Wallgrave Road, and it was a… one of these Victorian houses which was done up, and then I left home and did other things</p>
<p><em>What did you do?</em></p>
<p>I was a, first of all a legal secretary, and… then I went to North Africa for a year to Tripoli to be an au pair with an army family, because, I thought I’d do something different, and err.. I thought it sounded interesting. But I soon realised that the army life was not for me, people thought I’d marry a young officer but I didn’t like the army, I decided immediately that was erm… I was quite glad when that came to an end</p>
<p><em>And what did you not like about the army?</em></p>
<p>It was too rigid, too ordinary, everybody was doing the same thing. Uhhh, all the furniture was the same, and the houses, it was… all… twits</p>
<p><em>All twits? [laughs] Umm, was it very different from the kind of environment that you’d grown up in?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes it was much closer, so I left that and then I became an air hostess. First with a small cross channel line and then with British United Airways, for nine years, which became… which was Freddie Laker’s independent line. When I gave that up, when I first married I became a legal secretary and then a medical secretary at the London Hospital and medical college for many years. And then I, overlapping with that I became a yoga teacher, which I still teach yoga these days, not privately, I taught at the Mary Ward Centre in Russell Square for 19 years… and now I just teach a few private people and I volunteer teaching disabled people</p>
<p><em>And what kind of yoga do you teach?</em></p>
<p>Errr… sort of mixture of all sorts, it’s not iyengar, not the Madonna sort of yoga, it’s taught by the British School of yoga, it’s influenced by the [sivananda?] school of yoga but it’s a bit of everything</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Fantastic</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Excellent, umm, what, when did you get married?</em></p>
<p>Bill and I got married in 1984, but I married my first husband in 19… 74</p>
<p><em>And can you remember…</em></p>
<p>And that’s how we moved this side of London because he had a business selling… he took over a business from a friend selling everything but the meat for the butcher, butcher sundries, which is funny because I’m vegetarian, and we moved into South Woodford, and when the marriage broke up I could afford to by a flat in Leyton, but not in South Woodford, and I… or further into town so it’s just how I ended up this side of London, in 1981</p>
<p><em>So you weren’t, so when you were first married you, you had your house together in…</em></p>
<p>South Woodford</p>
<p>…<em>in South Woodford.Right ok. Can you, can you tell me about the day of your marriage?</em></p>
<p>What to my fir..second husband?</p>
<p><em>No to your first husband</em></p>
<p>Oh, we were living in St James’ Park, we went to the registry office umm… just during the day it was very low key</p>
<p><em>Mmm. And what was his name?</em></p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p><em>Tony?</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Excellent, umm… and then the broke up and you came to Leyton?</em></p>
<p>Yess, mmm</p>
<p><em>And wha… did you move to this house?</em></p>
<p>No I moved in, I was in a flat in Newport Road, two roads away, upstairs flat which I bought with, after the break-up of our marriage. And then Bill lived, umm, not too far away and we met up because, through the CND movement</p>
<p><em>Hmmm, so what what were you, what was your involvement with the CND movement?</em></p>
<p>I umm, secretary, membership secretary, I also went to Greenham Common for weekends, and stayed there, which was very interesting. I cut holes in the fence, which was very interesting. I didn’t stay there all the time, but I just, a group of us used to go down for the weekend</p>
<p><em>And do you have lots of memorabilia from that, from that as well?</em></p>
<p>I haven’t got xxxx photographs, I was removed from there as well [laughs]</p>
<p><em>So what errr… inspired your interest in participating in politics?</em></p>
<p>Well…</p>
<p><em>How did you get involved in activism?</em></p>
<p>I was brought up in a Tory household and then when I realised, and looked around me I became Labour. Umm… and I’ve always been interested… now, since Tony Blair and the invasion of Iraq I’ve joined the Green Party, because I was fed up with… Labour being little Tories, so now I’m for the Green Party</p>
<p><em>So was it fairly straight forward for you to become involved in doing, kind of, non-violent direct action?</em></p>
<p>Yes, oh, yes</p>
<p><em>It just felt like a…</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>…like a obvious thing to do?</em></p>
<p>Obvious thing to do</p>
<p><em>And was the, your involvement with the M11 the first time you’d… no, because Greenham Common</em></p>
<p>No because I’d been at Greenham Common, Greenham Common, M11, mmm</p>
<p><em>So GreenhamCommon, was Greenham Common your first…</em></p>
<p>Yes, Greenham Common, mmm</p>
<p><em>...involvement with, with kind of activism</em></p>
<p>That must have been in ’81, a long time ago</p>
<p><em>Mmmm… and did you make lots of, did you have lots of friends there?</em></p>
<p>I had a few friends who lived in Wanstead, we used to go down as, in a camping van and spend the night, spend the weekend… and I taught yoga there as well… to the women</p>
<p><em>To the women?</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Ooh. Excellent.Mmm, and how, how did you first hear about the…umm the proposed M11 road?</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember, it was in the air as it were, and the first time I was aware of Claremont Road was when I came back from the swimming pool and I saw, I don’t… it had been there and we realised and it was how… many sculptures and flowers and decorations there were, and then it all fell into place, and we used to go to meetings every so often… to plan out actions</p>
<p><em>And where were the meetings held?</em></p>
<p>They were in a church hall in Leyton… Methodist church hall</p>
<p><em>And who, who attended them?</em></p>
<p>Jacky, Bill, myself, umm…. [Bundy?]… Henry, Henry Cox, Effing never did ‘cos he wasn’t organised, and a few people</p>
<p><em>So, umm, the people that you’ve mentioned, are they mostly local residents, who became involved in the, in the protest?</em></p>
<p>Mostly, mostly residents, local residents, but a lot of people came and visited Claremont Road because it became quite famous, as well as the tree in Wanstead, that they cut down, that became famous, just like Greenham Common was famous, we got visitors from all over the world at Greenham Common and at the tree in Wanstead</p>
<p><em>And did you spend a lot of time at the tree in Wanstead?</em></p>
<p>Ummm, a bit of time, not as much as Claremont Road but yes, I went there</p>
<p><em>And what do you remember about the tree?</em></p>
<p>I remember a beautiful chestnut tree… surrounded by boards which people pulled down, errr, it was a lovely tree and they cut it down, and people were living in it, and you could post letters to the tree</p>
<p><em>Did you ever post any letters?</em></p>
<p>Yes we did, we posted letters to the tree</p>
<p><em>[Laughs] Can you remember what you, what you wrote?</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember what I wrote</p>
<p><em>No?</em></p>
<p>I remember I was nearly arrested once because I was put… I was painting on the… one of the boards round the tree ‘No more CO’, carbon monoxide, I said wait a moment, he said if you could continue that and I’m going to arrest you, and I said listen, this is carbon… I’m doing carbon dioxide, CO2, not carbon monoxide and he said alright just finish what you’re drawing [laughs]</p>
<p><em>[laughs] that was very kind of him </em></p>
<p>[laughs]</p>
<p><em>Umm, and were you there the day that they pushed the boards down?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I was there the day they pushed the doors down, but I wasn’t there the day they cut the tree down xxxx</p>
<p><em>Why were you not there?</em></p>
<p>I can’t remember, I was just… maybe teaching up in town</p>
<p><em>Mmm, teaching yoga?</em></p>
<p>Yes, mmm. Well, maybe I was at work, I think I was at the medical college in those… either teaching yoga in town, yep sorry. I was teaching yoga, I used to teach at the Mary Ward Centre, as I said, and it xxxx daytime job, Tuesday and Wednesday I taught in the daytime</p>
<p><em>Mmm, excellent. And so then after the tree was cut down then, then the sort of the main focus of the protest moved to Claremont Road, is that right?</em></p>
<p>I think it was after Claremont Road</p>
<p><em>Oh really?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it was afterwards, yep</p>
<p><em>So, errm, so your first memory of Claremont Road was on your way back from the swimming pool?</em></p>
<p>That’s, well I was there and we realised it was there and you could go along and say hello to people but I realised… it’d exploded into all this lovely sculptures and blossoms and… and that was when I was really aware of it, and we started going to the meetings</p>
<p><em>Ok, and aside from local residents were there… because there were lots of protesters who had, who.. who moved in and squatted…</em></p>
<p>A lot xxxx, the houses were emptied of their residents, except for Dolly who had been there for 93 years… and if I can find that photograph I’ll send it to you, and the squatters moved in, all along the proposed link road, in Fillebrook Road as well, and in Wanstead and they occupied the houses</p>
<p><em>And did they attend the same meetings that you were attending?</em></p>
<p>Some did. Sometimes they tried to get into the houses and destroy them by taking out the bathrooms and the stairwells</p>
<p><em>Why did they do that?</em></p>
<p>Not the protesters, the authorities</p>
<p><em>The authorities, I see</em></p>
<p>And some houses were left empty and guards, some security guards, mostly from West Africa moved in</p>
<p><em>Moved, moved in to live? Or to guard?</em></p>
<p>To xxxx to guard and xxxx. If a house was emptied… umm, they moved in</p>
<p><em>And then, then they couldn’t be reclaimed by the…</em></p>
<p>Mm, yeah. There was also Colville Road, and that was the next one on from Claremont Road, and that was also, half of that was demolished</p>
<p><em>And half of it still exists? Can we look again on the map?[laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yep, where’s the map? Here we are… Colville Road.. hm hmm hmm… [silence]…</p>
<p>[Sounds of pages being turned]</p>
<p>xxxx road?... [sound of more pages being turned]… you can barely see it, here we are, Colville Road, it’s on the corner here, Colville Road, can you see there?</p>
<p><em>Oh yeah, so that’s… let me just get it in context…</em></p>
<p>That was Colville Road there</p>
<p><em>So it’s just off Grove Green Road as well</em></p>
<p>Just off Grove Green Road, and that had houses both sides, and now it has houses just one side… so Colville Road was also a scene of protest and then Claremont Road just followed on towards Leytonstone station towards Colville Road</p>
<p><em>So, oh hang on I’ve lost it again now… oh there, so there’s Colville Road, so… so Claremont Road was along here?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, along here yes. There still is a teeny bit left with one or two houses</p>
<p><em>And how far up did it go?</em></p>
<p>As far as the bridge… Cathall Road, this is the swimming baths you see and you used… we went along there</p>
<p><em>Ok, so it ran between Colville Road and Cathall Road</em></p>
<p>Yep, yeah</p>
<p><em>Ok excellent, ah that’s good. I haven’t quite, there’s lots of this that I haven’t quite figured out yet… Hmm.</em></p>
<p>Have you come from far then?</p>
<p><em>Hackney [laughs]</em></p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p><em>Hackney</em></p>
<p>Where’s that? Oh, quite a long way, hmm?</p>
<p><em>Well not too, yeah… on the other side of the marshes. Ummm…. </em></p>
<p>Oh Hackney!</p>
<p><em>Hackney</em></p>
<p>Oh that’s not far yeah</p>
<p><em>No [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[Sound of movements] I’ll just find… these photographs. Hmm hm hm. Oh no that’s different photographs… never mind I can’t find that one, but I will…</p>
<p><em>No don’t worry, that’s absolutely fine, ummm…</em></p>
<p>Not what…</p>
<p><em>So the meetings, can you remember any of the actions that you planned in the meetings?</em></p>
<p>We made, we planned to blockade the… blockade the err, we blockade the two shops, there was… there were two shops called W. S. Atkins, the people who were promoting the road to the public and we made sure that they were shut, sometimes we barricaded them</p>
<p><em>And how did they promote the road, what did they do?</em></p>
<p>They were promoting it as a good thing, with billboards and explanations</p>
<p><em>So they were almost like, kind of, like show homes</em></p>
<p>They were show, they were show, show rooms, mmm</p>
<p><em>Rooms</em></p>
<p>There was one in Wanstead and there was one in… in Leytonstone and umm… there was quite a lot of action taken at those places</p>
<p><em>Such as?</em></p>
<p>Blockading, umm somebody… jammed up the letterboxes, and oh… somebody broke some windows, err… they were, physically blockading it so no one could get in or out</p>
<p><em>So was there a fairly continuous presence there?</em></p>
<p>Continuous presence up there, always somebody out there</p>
<p><em>With banners?</em></p>
<p>With banners, yep. With banners, photo… cameras</p>
<p><em>And did you have, like, leaflets?</em></p>
<p>Yes, leaflets xxxx</p>
<p><em>That you handed out to people. So do you think there was a lot of public support for umm… for the protest or was…</em></p>
<p>I think there was, at the time</p>
<p><em>Hmmm</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Mmmm… and… can you remember any other actions you did apart from blockading the showrooms?</em></p>
<p>Umm, sometimes… people put things through letterboxes that weren’t very nice [laughs], no we more or less… we’re recorded, we blockaded most of the time and… just kept an eye on things</p>
<p><em>And the relationship between the residents and the local umm… and the activists, the squatters, we you, aside from the meetings we you doing, we you kind of doing the same protest work, or did you see yourselves as kind of separate?</em></p>
<p>No, we were doing the same protest rote. Mmm</p>
<p><em>Mmmm</em></p>
<p>And most people didn’t just turn their back, and didn’t worry too much</p>
<p><em>Hmm</em></p>
<p>But they were a lovely ss.. terrace of houses and it was so nice and peaceful there, with very little traffic before… it became a centre for protest, because it was just.. there was one, there was the central line and a row of trees, and it was a lovely quiet places and people had parties there, there was… a canteen</p>
<p><em>Before it was a protest site?</em></p>
<p>When it became a protest site</p>
<p><em>When it became a protest site</em></p>
<p>Before then it was a just a a row of very quiet houses</p>
<p><em>Mm, do you have memories of it before it became a protest site?</em></p>
<p>Just vague when I moved into the area and was exploring</p>
<p><em>Mmm, so what was your kind of early impression of the area when you moved here?</em></p>
<p>Very friendly… when I lived in South Woodford, the area was, it’s not very friendly but as soon as I moved into Leyton and Leytonstone people mix them up… very friendly area, made friends very soon</p>
<p><em>Mmm… and so just tell me again how long you’ve been in the area, did you tell me the year?</em></p>
<p>I moved into a, I left South Woodford and moved to Leyton in 1981</p>
<p><em>That’s right</em></p>
<p>Bill and I met in 1983, he moved into my flat in Leyton and we married in 1984 and we moved here in 1991… people mix up Leyton and Leytonstone but their all jumble up together, like a jigsaw</p>
<p><em>So did, so you lived in both?</em></p>
<p>I lived in both</p>
<p><em>Yeah and you moved here in 1994, and can you remember the day that, I mean I’m sure you can remember the day that you married Bill but can you tell…</em></p>
<p>[both talking at once]Oh yes</p>
<p><em>…me a little bit about that?</em></p>
<p>It was umm lovely we had a… lovely reception and we umm we went to the registry office in Walthamstow… and then our reception was at the nurse’s home at the London hospital… so the first reception was a dinner, a late lunch in an Italian restaurant in Leytonstone and then that weekend we had a big party and we used the nurse’s home at the London hospital</p>
<p><em>And were you working there at the time?</em></p>
<p>I was working at the medical college</p>
<p><em>Ahh ok</em></p>
<p>As a medical secretary</p>
<p><em>Mmm, lovely and did lots of people come?</em></p>
<p>Ooh loads I can’t remember how many, loads of people came, it was good, really good</p>
<p><em>And that was in, that was in eighty…</em></p>
<p>‘84</p>
<p><em>…four</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Ok so that was, that was pre Claremont…</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Long, long pre Claremont Road, and was Bill involved in Claremont Road as well?</em></p>
<p>Yes he was, yep mmm</p>
<p><em>And how, what was his involvement?</em></p>
<p>Well he just came and then… part of the protest</p>
<p><em>And you mentioned earlier that you’d had some direct act… non violent direct action training…. xxxx</em></p>
<p>Yes that was arranged by CND</p>
<p><em>Can you remember, can you remember anything about it?</em></p>
<p>As far as I remember they just told us not to xxxx not to swear, not to be rude, to go limp if you were carried away, to just tell people politely what you were protesting about, and umm don’t take it personally… and don’t try and get in a tizz if somebody you love if somebody you love is being handled, just take it slowly and carefully</p>
<p><em>And was there, were there instructions on what to say to police if you were arrested and that kind of thing?</em></p>
<p>Just say… not very much just keep quiet, accept that you’re a protester</p>
<p><em>And were you ever arrested?</em></p>
<p>No I was never arrested, neither at Greenham nor [laughs] anywhere else</p>
<p><em>Lucky escape</em></p>
<p>I was removed but I was never, I was never arrested</p>
<p><em>Excellent, umm and so we’ve talked about the, the day that the, do you remember ummm… coming back to Claremont after it, were you there when the demolition was happening?</em></p>
<p>No because nobody, then they did close it off. The demolition happened in, on, on Wednesday I think.. Monday is the hit, if you’ve seen those photographs then they closed it off both ends and they had to remove the protesters from the Claremont Tower and from the nets above Claremont Road, from the superstructure above Effing Mick’s house and all the way and they cleared them all away be Wednesday</p>
<p><em>And how did they… </em></p>
<p>And by Wednesday, then the security guards moved in from West Africa I think they were and they soon… then the road was cleared off and they demolished the houses</p>
<p><em>And how did they remove the protesters, what was the process that they went through?</em></p>
<p>Errr they, some were chained to the railings, some were chained up on to, on to the, they had to cut the chains get people on, found them on ladders to carry them down… and… moved them eventually but it took a long time</p>
<p><em>And were people injured? </em></p>
<p>I don’t think anybody was badly hurt, nobody was ended up in hospital and I don’t think many people were arrested, then cut them away from the roofs they went up the roofs they got them down… specialist forces had to go up Claremont Tower to remove the protesters from the top and that was Wednesday, from Monday to Wednesday they were there</p>
<p><em>And where did, where were they taken once they were brought down?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know I think they were just let go</p>
<p><em>And they mostly just left without, they didn’t… kind of try to come back?</em></p>
<p>I don’t think they could, it was impossible then it was blocked off, both ends of Claremont Road, you couldn’t get back, there was great big barricades</p>
<p><em>And so do you remember coming, do you remember seeing the area for the first time after the houses had been...</em></p>
<p>[both talking at once]Yes</p>
<p><em>…demolished?</em></p>
<p>It was very very desolate, very very, in fact I think the houses stayed up for a few months, as far as I remember, you couldn’t get near there and as I say one of the security males took on Effing Mick’s cat, that was Friday. The last resident of Claremont Road was Effing Mick’s orange cat</p>
<p><em>[laughs] Who was taken on by a security guard?</em></p>
<p>Yes, mmm</p>
<p><em>A West African security guard?</em></p>
<p>A West Af… errr, I don’t know who it was, but anyway it was taken on, I’d heard he’d been taken on by a security guard, and he was alright</p>
<p><em>That’s very sweet. And did you have, aside from being carried away and going limp, did you have much… erm either contact with police or security guards?</em></p>
<p>Not at all, no no no</p>
<p><em>You managed to avoid them more or less</em></p>
<p>Yes, I didn’t have much contact with them again, no, no reason to</p>
<p><em>Hmm… erm… so yeah, so it was… how, how was the road boarded off?</em></p>
<p>It was, as far as I remember it was boarded up with concrete slabs, you couldn’t get in, you couldn’t. They must have been able to get in, mustn’t they? I can’t remember how they blocked off but they had, it was all… blocked off both ends. People could obviously get in and out, the security people but that was…</p>
<p><em>But it seemed particularly impenetrable to anybody else, yeah?</em></p>
<p>Mmm, mmm</p>
<p><em>Ok and then they came and demolished…</em></p>
<p>Then they came and demolished all the houses</p>
<p><em>And you didn’t see that happening?</em></p>
<p>I… think I saw some of happening yup</p>
<p><em>How did you feel?</em></p>
<p>I felt really sad, it was very… bleak and desolate</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>‘Cos I don’t think some of the houses came down until January because I went to pick my mother up, umm, to spend Christmas with us, after my father died and I hired a car to get her over London and I showed her where Claremont Road was and there was still some houses standing and that was, must have been umm… December ninety… four</p>
<p><em>And so do you remember umm… telling, telling your mum, your mother about…</em></p>
<p>Oh yes, she she knew, she knew what it was about</p>
<p><em>What was her position, what did she think, as a Tory?</em></p>
<p>She thought it was a bit fruitless</p>
<p><em>So you didn’t see eye to eye politically?</em></p>
<p>Not politically, no no, hmmm</p>
<p><em>And do you remember the building of the road?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I remember the building of the road it was eventually built, over several years and it, well it’s now a sort of tunnel… er not in a tunnel, they wouldn’t do cut and cover which means that they could have cut it up and covered it up and not demolished the houses, it’s in a sort of ditch, a big err… channel now, about ten metres deep</p>
<p><em>Mmmm</em></p>
<p>And I remember how I saw when it was, when they cut down there was a layer of sand… mmm interesting to see, now it’s all…</p>
<p><em>Underneath the top soil?</em></p>
<p>Yes now it’s all, it’s sealed now and it’s err just the… M11 link road, or the A12 they call it</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Umm, and did it, did it cause a lot of disruption while it was being built?</em></p>
<p>It did yes, it was very noisy</p>
<p><em>Noisy?</em></p>
<p>Noisy</p>
<p><em>And umm… more traffic or were there kind of traffic jams and things around?</em></p>
<p>Well actually it has eased the traffic jams, Grove Green Road which is, you can see along, it used to be chock-a-block full, it has relieved the traffic jams</p>
<p><em>And do you use it much now to get out of London?</em></p>
<p>I don’t have a car, but I’ve been on it in… cars, obviously… on buses and coaches mmm</p>
<p><em>Mmm. So what’s your feeling about it now, do you think it was a good thing that it was built or a bad thing?</em></p>
<p>I think it was a bad thing, it could have easily ummm put, made a tunnel of it, they destroyed beautiful houses, it wasn’t necessary just to get people into London a bit quicker</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. And do you think it’s had any, what kind of effect do you think it’s had on the local community?Any?</em></p>
<p>Not these days, but what it has done, people have thought twice… about umm building motorway extensions, because what I haven’t told you is that I was also involved a few years later at Newbury bypass… and there were a lot of protest there</p>
<p><em>And were you involved in those?</em></p>
<p>I was involved in that, I went down for weekends, I went down with a group of people. We used to hire a coach early morning and go down there</p>
<p><em>And was that a relatively similar experience, or was that quite different?</em></p>
<p>It was… it was different, it was more rural… more more permanent err… there were loads of tents instead of houses</p>
<p><em>But was it similar people?</em></p>
<p>Similar people, similar people in Newbury and it was near where I used to live in Burghclere so I was quite interested</p>
<p><em>And since, since that have you remained politically active?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I’m politically active with the Greens now… I go on climate change demonstrations</p>
<p><em>Mmm… and what do you think xxxx…. Have you got any thoughts on the kind of development of the environmental activism since then, does it seem like a kind of linked up… </em></p>
<p>[both talking at once]Yes it seems to, there are still err….</p>
<p><em>…process? Does it, do they all seem to relate to each other?</em></p>
<p>There still are protests going on but I think the… the powers that be have thought twice about, about doing these motorway extensions because of the, so many protests and the costs of protests so I think there has been some success there</p>
<p><em>Mmm. Were you involved at all in, in umm any kind of anti GM?</em></p>
<p>No I haven’t</p>
<p><em>No? Or… um, or climate, climate activism, any kind of climate activism?</em></p>
<p>I go to the climate march</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>Which I’m not, I’m not particularly active there, I just go along</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Excellent, umm… I think maybe I have run out of questions… but… I’m sure that there’s, I’m sure that there’s things that I haven’t asked you about, so is there anything that you thought that I would, that we’d cover that we haven’t really?</em></p>
<p>I think you have actually covered almost what’s happened in the last few years</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>Except umm… I was always treated with a role of respect by the security people, praps because I was a bit older</p>
<p><em>So yeah, you said that they were West Africans, do you know…</em></p>
<p>[Both speaking at once] These was a, no the people who actually removed us were the riot squad, all English Brits people with the helmets, the people that actually moved in to protect, to live in the houses were a lot of West African people who, I think they just lived in the houses, they probably got paid six pence a week and, just to live there</p>
<p><em>And did you ever talk to any of them?</em></p>
<p>Occasionally, they didn’t speak much good English</p>
<p><em>Mmm, and did you get the sense that they were… err… kind of supportive or…?</em></p>
<p>I didn’t, I think they just wanted to get into the country and somewhere to live</p>
<p><em>Yeah, sure so it was good for them in that sense?</em></p>
<p>It was good for them in that sense</p>
<p><em>That the pro…</em></p>
<p>That they were in the UK and they had some sort of job to do</p>
<p><em>So they probably wanted to extend the protest for as long as possible</em></p>
<p>Probably, probably, mmm</p>
<p><em>Yeah, ok, anything else that I…</em></p>
<p>No I think that’s all, and you’ve got the pho… now what shall we do about these photographs, do you want to xxxx [sound of items being moved]</p>
<p><em>Oh, can I, actually there were a couple of other questions</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah</p>
<p><em>I wanted to ask you about the ghost house which you mentioned in your article, and I… do y…</em></p>
<p>[both speaking at once] There was a ghost house and</p>
<p><em>Do you know what that…</em></p>
<p>They, they had it opened for a weekend I think and it was quite fun, it made sort of</p>
<p><em>What was it?</em></p>
<p>Well there were sort of screechy things and owls hooting and and… spiders webs and [laughs]</p>
<p><em>Oh so it was a bit like a kind of, almost like a fairground ghost house?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it was like a fairground ghost house yes, it wasn’t haunted, it was just</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>[laughs] quite fun</p>
<p><em>Ok excellent and that was on Claremont?</em></p>
<p>That was on Claremont Road yes, ghost house, they had it open specially for a weekend and it was great fun</p>
<p><em>So was it, it was just one weekend?</em></p>
<p>I… two or three weekends I think</p>
<p><em>And did you… ‘cos they had regular street parties didn’t they?</em></p>
<p>They had street parties, I was just going to mention, they had streets parties. So you went along and I… the canteens I gave them, when I had too many apples for instance, from my apple tree, I’d bring them along and they were very grateful</p>
<p><em>That’s nice [laughs]. Umm… and I, also in your article you mentioned an open university project and I just wanted to ask you about that</em></p>
<p>I did an OU degree and one of the years was the environment course and we had to do a project and my project was the, was the M11 link road and I had to put both sides of the case of course, so umm… I stepped into the lion’s den and when to W S Atkins and interviewed Bob Brazier there to ask what the plans were, what was going to happen next, how were they going to deal with the protesters, and ummm… I told that to the… to the… meetings against the M11, but in my project I had to put both sides of the story that there had been traffic jams and I took photographs of the traffic jams as well</p>
<p><em>And who did you say you interviewed, Bob Brazier?</em></p>
<p>Bob Brazier was the… person who ran W S Atkins which was the government agency that has two shops which were… shall we say umm… well we won’t [coughs and laughs]</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>A lot of protests went along</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>And there was one day ummm… I think he had a sense of humour because there was one day we decided, it was April Fool’s I think day, and we went along and… xxxx this shop is for sale at knocked down prices and we put all these notices on the door and I think he was quite amused at that</p>
<p><em>And what was it like talking to him when you interview him?</em></p>
<p>He was quite, he was quite a reasonable person, he had his fu.. he had his point of view to put forward</p>
<p><em>And what was his point of view?</em></p>
<p>That the road should be built</p>
<p><em>Because…</em></p>
<p>He had to umm… he was supposed to put forward the government point of view, about the desirability of relieving traffic jams and to have a faster road link in to London</p>
<p><em>And did he know where your sympathies lay?</em></p>
<p>Not at that stage, no he didn’t know, he was just a, I was just posing as I was, an open university student asking what’s going to happen, how is he going to deal with protesters… which of course I took straight back to the meeting</p>
<p><em>And were the protesters pleased?</em></p>
<p>They were quite please yeah</p>
<p><em>Did you interview them as well?</em></p>
<p>The protesters? No I didn’t, no no, I was with them, a part of the protesters, we had meetings every so often</p>
<p><em>No I just wondered if for you degree you kind of</em></p>
<p>No, umm</p>
<p><em>What was your degree, what was the degree in?</em></p>
<p>Environment, I’ve got a BSc, I’ve got envirxxxx, I’ve got environmental sciences</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>I did that, that was several years ago</p>
<p><em>Excellent</em></p>
<p>Mmm</p>
<p><em>Ummm…mmmm… the cat and the kittens I wanted to ask you about, but you’ve talked about that… oh I also just, err in your email you said that it… it won’t be the first time that you’ve been interviewed, so I just wondered if umm, who had interviewed you before</em></p>
<p>Errr, I haven’t actually, let me see have I been interviewed umm probably I’ve been interviewed or I’ve been talked about it</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>I’ve been talking to people about it, I haven’t been, not interviewed at this sta, at this depth anyway. I have talked about it, when I had the photographs up on a overhead projector</p>
<p><em>Where was that?</em></p>
<p>In a t… in… the church hall at Leytonstone</p>
<p><em>Ah</em></p>
<p>And at the library at Leytonstone as well</p>
<p><em>It was just a kind of exhibition?</em></p>
<p>Yes, an exhibition, it’s been in two or three exhibitions, and other people have used them, the photographs, and some have actually paid me for them, which is nice</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em></p>
<p>It’s going in a book about the M11 protests</p>
<p><em>Oh, who’s doing that?</em></p>
<p>Umm… [sound of movements] I’ll have a look and see if I can find it… aaaagh… [sound of tapping at a keyboard]… that’s Claremont, our cat</p>
<p><em>[laughs] that’s a lovely cat, good name</em></p>
<p>Mmm… if I could find… [sound of a computer mouse clicking]… what would you like me to do, would you like me to send you some of those, scan and send you some of those photos?</p>
<p><em>I would love you to, yes</em></p>
<p>I’ve got your email address so it’ll take a little bit of time</p>
<p><em>That’s fine</em></p>
<p>I’ve got some on the computer but not all of them… [sound of computer mouse clicking]… I need to wait until it, it receives all this junk, 17 bloody emails…</p>
<p><em>[laughs]</em></p>
<p>…as soon as it’s clear I can go straight to… [silence]…[more clicking and tapping]…</p>
<p><em>Ohhhh, Paul Hawkins</em></p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p><em>He’s the person who’s, who’s the, who’s book… ahhh, yes</em></p>
<p>I think he’s using some of my images</p>
<p><em>Ok</em></p>
<p>Do you know him? Xxxx</p>
<p><em>I errmm… I haven’t met him but I’ve been in contact with him, yeah, ok</em></p>
<p>Yes he used some of my images, err… yes earlier this year</p>
<p><em>Excellent</em></p>
<p>[Sound of mouse clicking]… yes, that’s, they’ve been used, they have been used in, earlier this year</p>
<p><em>Excellent</em></p>
<p>And the rest are yours I think, yeah</p>
<p><em>Mmm… </em></p>
<p>[sound of mouse clicking]</p>
<p><em>Yes I’ve, I’m trying to meet Paul but I don’t think he lives in London so it’s slightly difficult. Mmm… </em></p>
<p>Right</p>
<p><em>Ok, shall I…</em></p>
<p>Now what about this copyright thing, are you… I’ve got this… form</p>
<p><em>Shall I turn this off, shall I stop this now?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes I think so, we’re…</p>
<p><em>Ok, thank you</em></p>
