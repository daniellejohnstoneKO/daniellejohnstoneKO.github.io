Economically, the Asian people financially could afford to live like that. And there was still some on the fringe of it, poor, poor Asian xxxx, very poor, who couldn’t afford those kind of, houses, very few. And they would live on the outskirts. You know, something had, happened to that family or whatever, whether orphaned, or the father couldn’t work or whatever, some, some of those kind of families did live on the fringe. Um, I think familiarity, sharing of each others, needs and wants and desires brought them together. That, in that way it is like colonial, because the whites in India felt more comfortable. But what they did do is they tried to create, an environment specifically replicating, bit like England. And that was unique, whereas, I don’t think the Ugandan Asians tried to create a New Delhi, or Mumbai. In any part of Uganda, if you see my point. Or try to say, ok, we’re going to have it like India now. It wasn’t in that way, so I wouldn’t, I’m , I’m not sure about calling it colonial, but I’m definitely um, I think the Ugandan Asians created a life which was economically, and politically as well, and socially, a much more convenient for them to be together. </h3>

And that enriched our connection with people. So the village experience where my grandfather had settled…in Branga, with a little shell, and a little involvement with the local cotton xxxx, and he opened up a shop, which would sell, sell the local people. So basic ingredients, salt, sugar, cooking oil, um, material, er, you know, er, rolls of material like in, like you see today in Mister Selfridge, kind of thing. But very, very tiny, small shop, we wouldn’t even call it Mister Selfridge little corner room, basically that sort of shop. Um, so, saying that, that’s what I remember of the shop, but initially it might have been even smaller. The shell, is, is like er, like a petrol station, but it’s not. It’s one drum with petrol in it, and it would have a pump, so the travelling people from where ever, would stop to fill up their vehicles. Going to Goolu, mostly towards the end, that were, well, with a lot of the lorries transporting, raw cotton, millets and other things to the xxxx so it worked quite well. Now, that perspective is my grandfathers connection with the Muslim community, local African community, Ali’s family came from Sudan, and, and so, these are the people that we actually had, then generations later, continued to have respect and relationship. Obviously you wouldn’t go and dine and wine, but some of us, as kids, not dine and wine, but we didn’t have fear of going in the huts and stuff like that. </h3>

Now, as the youngest in my family, the rest had been sent to school, so what I remember is my father’s shop always had a little, er, at peak time maybe three or four tailors. So they would be on the veranda of the shop, people would buy the material, and the women would have their dresses made instantly and come back in two hours time. So to speak. Er, by the time I was about, five when I remember, we had one particular er, tailor, Denasia, and he, his hut was not behind our back yard, not far to walk, and he had got his grandson, who was about my age, Tana. And it was ok for me to walk around with him, play with him, you know, and that, I don’t think many of my brothers and sisters did, because they were friends with each other. Where as I had Tana who was, used to just come over and things so, I perhaps had that connection with him which is something. And we used to [laughs], walk away, and there was a little place between, between where we lived to the little gin, cotton ginnery(?), and it was a little come school, come, it was one room basically. It was like one, er, like served like a hospital, er, like, kay um, like teaching kids school, and it was a little, I think a catholic little place. For worship, but in there was people or person, who if you cut yourself would put a bandage on it, clean it up for you and if you grazed your knee or something, you’d go, and you wouldn’t want to come and tell your parents in case they actually shouted at you for being naughty in the first place. And, and that I remember quite fondly actually so. </h3>

So now we are in Cairo airport right and this but I must share because it can be a bit adventurist when you look back but it was equally frightening so we all got off and said mum and dad because of the British passport and a couple of others were allowed a room or something in Cairo because they did not have enough facilities so all of us with passport A and B I could not understand what it was we have to queue up and there were all these cabs waiting outside Cairo airport black cabs then I remember we all then had to divide ourselves it did not matter by this stage as everybody was so scared and frightened so you just stood in a line and I think my sister and my grandmother got split up with me so it left me and my brother with two other Asian families and three other Asian people so we took the cab and the cab took us somewhere to eat. You know you have never seen anything like it because Cairo is full of noise blub….. the bus and then you got on to some side roads where there was supposed to be foods like nan bread and something made out of chick peas and we just we did we have not been used to eating anything like that and then we looked around and we were so frightened then the cab driver came and brought us back and then we landed somewhere here like Stanstead.

In those days so I even understood that which make things easier? And international economic that made things clearer</h3>

The childhood memories are something I think where ever you are you still remember, so I am quite found of that I think as it was in inverted common a charmed childhood you would remember it but I have occasionally got flashbacks, more so because now especially in my case I’m sharing with you what triggers my memories is mothering Sunday and my mother dies in 1992 and then my father died in 2009 so this weekend it is like you remember mum and you remember mum in different forms so I will remember Uganda for example erm. Certain things if there is something on the TV like Attenborough’s programmes suddenly I will float away and we used to do these things the documentaries that he has made in Africa and the lovely pictures and I think there are trigger points that do that but I don’t sit around thinking oh god Uganda, Uganda, Ugandans but I do want to visit it one day hopefully </h3>
