<p><em>Ok.</em></p>
<p>Yeah…um.</p>
<p>Do you remember anything about your school in Uganda?</p>
<p>School, no really, no. It was very, very er, vivid memories erm, er…not really, no. Erm… I know where we lived, y’know I can visua- think, see it in my, er…</p>
<p><em>What does it look like?</em></p>
<p>[Sighs] Oh God, it was a house at the bottom of the hill and the steps going all the way up to the top of the road, it was quite a lot of steps…Uhhh. Yeah, I don’t remember too, too much.</p>
<p><em>But you lived with your nan?</em></p>
<p>I lived with my grandmother, yes.</p>
<p><em>And, did you- did you have her…other people living with her too? Was it just two of you?</em></p>
<p>Erm, my er- at that time I think it was my uncle Jimmy. I think my Dad was living there too. I think that was it really. [<strong>Phone rings</strong>] Oh sor-sorr…[<em><strong>it’s alright</strong></em>]. [<strong>Clicking sound, then phone half rings</strong> <strong>-Talks to someone on the phone for 13 seconds</strong>]. [<strong>Phone beeps</strong>] Sorry,[<em><strong>that’s okay</strong></em>] I’m gonna have to take a XXXX out to a lady [<em><strong>yeah that’s fine, no problem</strong></em>].</p>
<p><em>And do you remember um…it’s back on now</em> [<strong>yeah</strong>]. <em>Do you remember leaving Uganda?</em></p>
<p>No really, no, I don’t remember leaving there, I kinda remember coming to England that’s it.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What do you remember about coming to England?</em></p>
<p>Ahhh, coming to England, and uh, being held in a, um, detention centre for six months. In I think it was Conbrooke by the airport, that’s where they had the detention centre.</p>
<p><em>Was this near Heathrow Airport?</em></p>
<p>Yes, near Heathrow Airport, yeah [<em><strong>okay</strong></em>]. This was back in I think ’72, yeah. When I think that maybe, [<strong>hissing sound</strong>] probably all other uh, Asian refugees was aswell.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. What was the detention centre like?</em></p>
<p>Uhhhmm, I don’t know, we just didn’t er– I think my gran and me just had the one room we shared that…and uh, just uh, just remembering all the, all the different people, just uh- I remember going to the canteen [<em><strong>mmm</strong></em>] that’s really all I remember, really, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Was it like a communal-being served communally, like a…like a soup kitchen but-</em></p>
<p>Yeah, kind of, yeah, you get your tray and go get your food and all that.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And, yeah.</p>
<p><em>And how long did you stay there?</em></p>
<p>I think it was six months, six months there…six months there, erm, then erm, at the time my, my aunt was living here, she was married, my er, grandmother’s daughter [<em><strong>mm-hmm</strong></em>] ah, near er, she lived in er, Hounslow. Um, so I think what happened there is- then after that they then er, put us…in Cranford [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>]…my gran and me, to be close to my aunt. Erm, but they put us in a caravan which was in the back in the garden, back of someone’s house.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>But it didn’t have uh, I can’t remember but again it wasn’t a very pleasant time.</p>
<p><em>So who’s, who’s house or whose, who was living on that site?</em></p>
<p>Erm my gran, me and my grandma were living in the caravan, erm…er…obviously it was probably rent from the council, y’know [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], given to the council, whatever but, er, yeah, that was very unpleasant, it was just a horrible place really. The uh, heating y’know, it was one of those g- portable heaters you had [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], it was cold, damp, it was terrible cos y’know, coming from a hot country like that and then coming here…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Yeah so it wasn’t very good. Uhmmm lived there- I d- can’t remember how long we lived there- we lived there for a while, then we got um, and obviously we were trying to get some housing, better housing, then they took, then they sent us to…from there…they sent us to Woking.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>We spent some time in Woking there, maybe a year or two… Erm, and in Woking it was erm, a place called Constitutional House, it was with other refugees- I remember a Tibetan guy at that time [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], there were people from Tibet coming. So I remember Tibetan guy- I remember Polish family there, they were there. It was good though because er, I then got sent to a school, private school. That’s where you- what you saw my gran’s pictures, a great green hat [<em><strong>mmm</strong></em>] and all that…Um so that was maybe a year…then obviously what my grandma’s trying to do is say to them, y’know, can we try and be closer to her daughter [<strong>hissing sound</strong>], because we didn’t have anyone else here.</p>
<p><em>Mmm.</em></p>
<p>Ummm, so we stayed there for a little bit and then I think the next step, then they sent us to Battersea…</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Uhh, they sent us to Battersea and uh, um I remember going to Latchmia School in Battersea, and that might have been for a year or two…I still can’t remember the d- time and dates…</p>
<p><em>But you were around eight, nine…</em></p>
<p>Eight, nine [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], yeah eight! Seven, eight, seven, eight. Or cert- somewhere around that area. So that was maybe for a year and we’re still trying to get closer to my aunt. Ah, from Battersea…where did they send us? We lived in…Cranford, in the, in the caravan…then they se- uh, and then Woking…then Battersea, then from Battersea they sent us to Norwood Green.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Ummm which was a nice two bedroom, uh flat in Norwood Green- so er, I finally had my own…room, <em>[<strong>yeah</strong>]</em> basically.</p>
<p>Ummm, so lived there for probably a year…um, then my dad eventually came because he was trying to get out of Uganda, he erm, was erm…he was trying to get out of Uganda and uh, every time he tried to get out they used to, y’know they er, erm, they took him off and they er, tortured him, he got tortured quite a bit. Erm…</p>
<p><em>He didn’t- he didn’t-he- what happened, did he not try to leave with you and your nan at the same time-</em></p>
<p>No, he er, basically what the er, my uncle and my er, er, dad said at the time, things are getting bad, we’ll get you two out and we’ll follow on, we’ll come later on.</p>
<p><em>So did you leave before the announcement?</em></p>
<p>Err, just slightly before [<em><strong>okay</strong></em>] yeah, yeah, cos they knew what was happening [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], so they said they would be safe, just for me and my gran to get out, um, so my dad tried to get out and then finally eventually he did get out. Umm so…when he came, then I went and lived with him in er, in er, errr rented accommodation in Cranford. [<em><strong>Mm-hm</strong></em>] I remember that. My grandmother stayed in Greenfor- uh, in Norwood Green.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Then eventually I think uh, um, what happened there is, I was nine or ten…t-eleven. Um…eleven by the time I moved, we moved out of Cranford with my dad…and we lived in Hounslow by Lampton School.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>So I went to Lampton School. My grandmother went from gr- from Norwood Green, they put her into the accommodation that she’s in now, which she’s been in there for twenty-five, thiry years maybe. Twenty-five years at least.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>Yes I think it’s something like that- I think it’s twenty-five odd years. Because I know that because she just had a- she just bought a TV last year because she kept that same TV for twenty-five years.</p>
<p><em>Wow</em> [<em><strong>Laughs</strong></em>].</p>
<p>XXXX personally I wanted to buy her something XXXX- but she’s, no!</p>
<p><em>She’s refused.</em></p>
<p>Refused. ‘This is the TV I've had, I’ll use it…till it goes, if only when.’</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Sooo, then I uh, went to Lampton School…erm uh, from er, eleven to seventeen, um, uh, then I went to uh, college, Hounslow Borough College [<em><strong>mm-hmm</strong></em>] for a couple of years. Ah, then I went to- then I started working-</p>
<p><em>What was your first job?</em></p>
<p>Er, first job was er, er erm, freight forwarding, I worked for a freight forwarding company, importing and exporting um, just the documentation, import export documentation clerk. That was around when I was eighteen and a half a and then by the time I was twenty…a green card which we had applied for [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>] came through so, my dad had also remarried as well, so, my stepmum, my dad and they had a kid as well, [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], his name is Amir, and er, we moved to America.</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>And that was in 1986. Erm, my gran was obviously still at the same er, um, home that she’s in now, [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>] and just moved to America.</p>
<p><em>Oh, going back to what you were talking about when you was in school, [</em><strong>yeah</strong><em>] in Hounslow, was it, your school in Hounslow-</em></p>
<p>Oh, Lampton School?</p>
<p><em>Lampton, yeah.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, high school.</p>
<p><em>Erm, can you remind me of your first day at school?</em></p>
<p>[<strong>Pause</strong>] Errr, not really, no [<strong>laughs</strong>].</p>
<p><em>Was it your secondary school?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, secondary school, yeah, yeah. Yeah, y’know it was er, it was okay, it was a good school.</p>
<p><em>Was it a mixed ethnicity XXXX a white school?</em></p>
<p>It was a mixed school, yeah a mixed school. There was er, Asians cos Hounslow had a lot of Asians at that time cos a lot of Asians came into Hounslow. Uhh yeah, it was a mixed school.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember coming across any Ugandan Asian communities, when you were-?</em></p>
<p>Errr, no, not really, no, no. No. It was kind of- it was kind of er, a little bit of the odd one out because I came from Uganda- a lot of the other peoples were, were either from India or Pakistan. So not many people were um, from Africa, just save y’know…</p>
<p><em>Yeah. And did you have like a mixed, social circle of friends, did you experience any issues?</em></p>
<p>Erm, well at that time when I was growing up in er, in er, where was that? I went to school, high school in ’77…and er…finished in ’83, erm, I mean there was a- yeah, in that period there was a lot of um, National Front erm [<em><strong>mmm</strong></em>], and British movement, it was a lot of racial- skinhead, I-I grew up in a skinhead area so it was [yeah] very, very tough time to grow up in, in this country, if you’re an Asian.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Ummm there was a lot of er, hatred.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember what any of your neighbours were like, th-the- your local community?</em></p>
<p>Um, well we lived in flats, very isolated in a sense y’know, we really didn’t er, er s- at that time when I was actually going to school, I was living with my dad, [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>] when I was about eleven and he was working shifts at the airport.</p>
<p><em>But what was he doing at the airport?</em></p>
<p>Er, I think he was in catering, in the catering, y’know where they catering for the airlines [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], he was doing something like that. But also, uh, y’know I was on my own quite a bit [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], at home.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So um…[<strong>someone enters and says ‘Alright, boss.’]</strong>Alright, thanks…Um so yeah, so I was on my own quite a lot so we didn’t really associate- the only time I went out was um, we all went out to see my gran a lot [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], and my aunts, and my uncles would visit, that’s it really. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Yeah and what was it like- what did you do in your spare time?</em></p>
<p>Oh basically, er, spare time was er, there was a park next to me at that time, at that time there was no video games so, [<em><strong>laughs</strong></em>]and on the TV channels, there was only three at the time.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Wasn’t any of those cable. My youth was spent out in the park playing football and cricket.</p>
<p><em>Really?</em></p>
<p>That’s it, every single day. Football and cricket, football summer holidays, football, cricket, football cricket. And then er, um…I think in 1979, when I was about thirteen or fourteen, I then uhm, my Dad sent me to America on my summer holidays, I would go to Minnesota and visit my aunt.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>On my summer holidays spent- most of my summer holiday cos he worked here all the time. So yeah that’s how I got to experience America at that time, in the early days, um, that’s why we-we went there cos we applied for our green card.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Basically we applied for our green card in 1918 (I think he means 1980 here), and we got it ’86.</p>
<p><em>You applied in 1918?</em></p>
<p>80 [<em><strong>80</strong></em>]. Yeah, 1980. Took nearly five and a half years to get. And at that time you can apply for it if you had a blood relative [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], which was my aunt, my dad’s sister, who was living there and she was a citizen.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Was there any particular reason why you wanted to go to America?</em></p>
<p>Uh,better life [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>]. A better life, yeah. I was a much, much better life, my parents knew it was and erm, cos we visited there and we knew…yeah.</p>
<p><em>So when you were growing up, um in London, you were saying- the community where you grew up was kind of very isolated and, there was a lot of skinheads?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did you have any like run-ins with them or did-</em></p>
<p>Luckily enough I didn’t, but errrr…y’know kept myself to myself [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], but it was very er, y’know it was very- you had to be very careful where you walked and stuff like that. Erm, erm, y’know at night or errr, yeah. You just had to be careful really.</p>
<p><em>Was there- were they physically very violent in that area XXXX-</em></p>
<p>Physically they were very intimidating, they were in groups all the time [<em><strong>mm-hm</strong></em>], there were never individuals…erm…yeah, yeah, y’know basically I’d come and go to school, come home, really go to the park and that’s it really, didn’t have much of a- didn’t do anything much than that [<em><strong>yeah</strong></em>], more than that.
