<p><strong>2012_esch_UgAs_05</strong></p>
<p><em>Well I’m just going to do a test. Em… can you just give me your full name and can you spell it for me if that’s OK. </em></p>
<p>OK. So, my full name is Vishva , V-I-S-H-V-A. Em, my surname until a year ago was Samani, S-A-M-A-N-I, but is now Sodhi S-O-D-H-I.</p>
<p><em>That’s perfect, right we are good to go. I’m just gonna pop this, over here if that’s OK</em></p>
<p>XXXX biscuits .</p>
<p><em>Yes lets swap, thank you very much. Do you mind I bring that a little bit closer to me is that OK?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.</p>
<p><em>Thank you. XXXX. Perfect.</em></p>
<p>Should I move XXXX?</p>
<p><em>No that’s fine. Right. These things are great, however, em if you go over the decimal level it just really destroys the em, the quality. Em…that’s perfect. OK then, right. em, so we’ve obviously got your name. em, can we start off with more personal details, date of birth and place of birth if that’s OK. </em></p>
<p>Ya, OK, so, date of birth is three zero, zero eight, nineteen eighty three. Em, and I was born here in Harrow, north west London at Northwick Park Hospital.</p>
<p><em>OK. So you are very local! [LAUGHS]</em></p>
<p>Very local yeah.</p>
<p><em>So you obviously grew up yeah, in Harrow. And have you ever lived anywhere else, sort of across the country? Move for university or…?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yeah em, so I was born in Kenton.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>Em, which Is part of Harrow. Em, and grew up in Harrow, went to school here, em and…when I was eighteen I went to Nottingham, university, for a few years but came back often, em, for weekends. Then…er, came to do postgraduate course in London, and then I have travelled quite a bit for work. Em, around the UK initially, then based myself overseas, em so have been on, and so really since, I’d say, post-university so from…actually I spent a year abroad during university aswell because it was a language degree so that year was spent abroad aswell and then there has been a lot of overseas travel really.</p>
<p><em>OK and em, you went to Nottingham what did you study at Nottingham?</em></p>
<p>Sorry, went on a roll there, [LAUGHS].</p>
<p><em>You’re my favourite kind of interviewee [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Em, sorry what was the question?</p>
<p><em>What did you study at…</em></p>
<p>So Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
<p><em>Spanish and Portuguese. OK, and em, postgraduate you went to…</em></p>
<p>Broadcast Journalism.</p>
<p><em>Broadcast journalism and what em, institution was that…in?</em></p>
<p>The postgraduate?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>At City University.</p>
<p><em>That was at City?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>OK. That’s the boring bit lets rock and roll then. I’m going to ask you about your parents now cos obviously…</em></p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p><em>… why, I got in contact with you. Em…can you tell me, em, you’ve already mentioned your mum was born in Tanzania did you say?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And your Father?</em></p>
<p>So Father was em, born and…raised as far as I’m aware in Uganda, in Soroti.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. In Uganda…</em></p>
<p>XXXX.</p>
<p><em>In Soroti OK. </em></p>
<p>XXXX.</p>
<p>And em, again, I mean I will gage this from your dad when I ask but it’s always nice to listen to your <em>perspective of your dad, obviously and his past. Em, can you tell me about his arrival in England, em… did he arrive with the first set of migrants in seventy two?</em></p>
<p>So my dad’s experience was a big difference to his siblings. His siblings experienced the kind of horror of the…of the, of being thrown out the country overnight. He…I know had come to England maybe anticipating that it was going to happen or something was going to happen the year before and em, I think had come here, to maybe try and settle , I don’t know find a home or something again, he’ll have to tell you the details of that cos he’s never…we’ve actually never really spoken about it . em, but I know that he had come here, and then, he had XXXX, and then the Ugandan Asians were being expelled and he was concerned how he was going to get his family out.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>So again, you ‘ll have to ask him the details about what happened there but I know that he was here from nineteen seventy one onwards, em…</p>
<p><em>Mhm, mhm.</em></p>
<p>He had to go back for something and then come back so I know there was some sort of…</p>
<p><em>Yeah some sort of…backwards and forwards.</em></p>
<p>So he very much sort of, as the older son of his family, took, took a lot of responsibility for looking after family so it was very much his, I think he saw it as his responsibility to get the family out of…</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>Uganda safely.</p>
<p><em>Is that traditional…amongst sort of, your community that the elder sibling would normally take responsibility…</em></p>
<p>Mm… depends on what the older sibling is like.</p>
<p><em>I suppose. </em></p>
<p>If they’re capable.</p>
<p><em>Depends on what the older sibling is like aswell I suppose [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>I mean I wouldn’t say its unique to the Ugandan Asian community I’d say its, I think in a lot of families that can naturally quite happen. Em, but yes, that was very much the case the dynamic of our family, of growing up…</p>
<p><em>And you mentioned siblings, em… </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Your Father’s siblings did they all relocate here?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, so they’re here now so its himself, his younger sister, he has two younger sisters one of them is based in Leicester so she is someone who did leave and does have a bit of em, sort of, did have a bad experience directly but again I have never really spoken to her about it. Em…and then he’s got, a second younger sister and a younger brother both are in London. one younger sister is one in Stratford, em and she is probably the most open, and she’s the one I interviewed in the BBC Radio 4 documentary, em...and her and her husband in particular em, who she met at a refugee camp in Kent and got married, em…</p>
<p><em>What a wonderful story.</em></p>
<p>Yes! That’s why you should speak to her! [LAUGHS].</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>And em, she’s probably the one between her and husband, my aunt and uncle they’re the ones of whom I’ve heard the most about the experiences of being Ugandan Asian in this country and the expulsion.</p>
<p><em>Again, I mean is that, is that do you think because cos she’s the youngest in the family. Do you think, or is it the nature of her persona…that she’s more open?</em></p>
<p>Er…yeah I think its probably that.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>I think its more about her personality, em…and then a younger brother, em, who again, he’s mentally quite kind of, mentally childlike so…he talks about it as if it was horrible when I ask him but I mean, he…I probably wouldn’t interview him.</p>
<p><em>Yeah OK.</em></p>
<p>And obviously then my father’s mothers and my grandmothers who’s here aswell, who also left then but has virtually can’t really speak any English so I speak to her in broken gujarati and…</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. But again but ive never really spoken to her, I’ve never really asked her…</p>
<p><em>Of course. It’s always the youngest kids, the youngest sibiling you have to keep your eye on I’ve noticed that. </em></p>
<p>[Laughs]. Speaking as the youngest.</p>
<p><em>Em, I mean…again, I’m, it might seem as a simplistic question or a question you don’t particularly want to answer, but it’s really just an opinion based question, I mean what, can you sort of perhaps, give me an idea if you could get into their heads and their experiences perhaps on their arrival perhaps, you’ve gone back to Uganda obviously aswell so you’ve had that perspective, I mean can you imagine some of the emotions they went through on arrival during the process of expulsion?</em></p>
<p>Em to be honest, not really I think what the, the Ugandan asian community seems to have done so well is…is, is not really made a big thing of it, and not really talked much about it. And…I really feel that most of peer group are quite blissfully ignorant of the challenges that their parents faced. There is some vague knowledge that my parents came her with very little, and…now live a comfortable life but I think what the Ugandan Asians have done, and again all of this is anecdotal and based on my impressions but em, is…they worked hard to, to build a sort of stable and secure em, life for their children. Their children are enjoying the fruits of that now.</p>
<p><em>Fruits of their labour.</em></p>
<p>Exactly, and therefore have no need to really question their parents struggle.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>Em… so, I don’t really…so I say that I could quite easily come into that category, unless the parents are the type to openly talk about it, em…I’d say the vast majority, a lot of my peer groups whose parents are ugand…they’re not even sure if their parents are Ugandan they have to check. Cos even when I was looking into this subject I had to find out, I think my dad’s from uganda, they didn’t even know so that’s the level…so in terms of…had I contemplated how it was like for them I think the…you know having the kind of em, mindset of a journalist I did start to question it and I am naturally interested in the, in the topic, in the experience of migration. Em, but I think I’m quite unusual in that regard.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. So, I mean you would say there’s a certain amount of perhaps detachment from the experience of the parents to the second generation?</em></p>
<p>I wouldn’t even call it detachment I’d say there’s ignorance.</p>
<p><em>Just clear ignorance yeah. I mean, do you, would you, do you think that’s because, em the parents of the first generation have actually guarded their children away from this, do you think, or…?</em></p>
<p>Em…its difficult to say, I think theres, theres, there could be many reasons, I think there’s a real overwhelming sense of lets just get on with life, em…lets not dwell on the past, em…and I think theres that kind of natural sense of protectiveness for why burden the younger generation with that knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Its tough enough us going through the process, why then transmit it to some XXXX, somebody who hasn’t had to go through it. </em></p>
<p>Absolutely, and I also just think its not in the, the culture of the people to of… certainly of the gujratis that I know to talk about, you know talking about your feelings is kind of a modern way of, of doing things and I don’t think maybe traditionally, people didn’t really do that so much in the way that we do now, we have the kind of luxury of time and comfort to do that [LAUGHS] .</p>
<p><em>Yep ,and spoiled I think. </em></p>
<p>[BOTH LAUGH].</p>
<p>Em, so I think that’s maybe one aspect, em…and I also, I mean I know when I ask my parents, you know what was it like being here and em… I know that the feel very grateful and a lot of them feel very grateful for the…opportunity they had to come here, and like quite grateful to like the british government, and…so there isn’t a sense of like, why should we complain about this cos we were actually really lucky…</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>…I mean that I know that my dad’s certainly, is of that…</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>XXXX.</p>
<p><em>XXXX could have been a lot tougher in Uganda. </em></p>
<p>Well yeah.</p>
<p><em>Especially considering the climates when they left. Em…do you…I mean I’m gonna go back to obviously your story now, when you were growing up, I mean, you’ve kinda touched on this anyways cos you had to XXXX check your parents, sort of heritage, ethnic, cultural, national heritage, but I mean were you aware of your sort of unique sort of unique heritage when you were growing up? I mean, you know, i know you never went through this process and you were never really a refugee yourself but you’re still the child of a refugee…</em></p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever feel that sense when you were growing up, or do you think because you said you’re parents guarded you away, did you notice it? </em></p>
<p>I think, I grew up in Northwest London where I think there’s a huge number, it’s a very multicultural em, area there are…I remember you know the school that I went to, em, which, I mean there were, it was, I wasn’t like the only Indian kid, I think now that school has a vast majority of [LAUGHS] gujaratis.</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS] I’m from Wolverhampton. </em></p>
<p>[LAUGHS] So you know, so, em…I never felt em, like certainly those experiences which are quite typically of em, something that comes from immigrant family that weren’t there, so, so strong, em…in terms of any, any struggle, no, again I really feel that ive had that kind of experience where, my parents have given, have worked very hard to give me a very comfort-, incredibly comfortable upbringing in life and not really em, that any struggle that they’ve been through has just been what I’ve observed, maybe subsconsciously rather than openly discussed or talked about…</p>
<p><em>XXXX actively taught or seeking…</em></p>
<p>Exactly yeah, em so no, that, that wasn’t very visable. You know, there’s the occasional reference to ‘oh when we were in Uganda we use to get nice fresh fruit and you know, and use to climb trees’ and that’s when my brother and I would be a bit like ‘oh god here he goes again’ so that, and that was the literally the extent to it.</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS] </em></p>
<p>And it was very kind of like, we didn’t know about uganda we didn’t really, It was on radar at all.</p>
<p><em>You don’t have a point of reference do you, I suppose?</em></p>
<p>No, exactly.</p>
<p><em>You haven’t been there before… its XXXX.</em></p>
<p>No, and I mean uganda isn’t really, if you’re really interested in international affairs then you know about uganda, but I think theres a lot of people who don’t really, and don’t really care much for it and isn’t on their radar. And I guess we were as kids, very much the same, there are certain, it would have been interesting to learn now that theres lots of language gujarati that we speak the type that we speak, has absorbed a lot of Swahili words and a lot of east African, em, words that I didn’t know so…in many ways that kind of influence of, uganda, of my fathers upbringing in uganda is there in a lot of things that we were saying and doing at home without us really even knowing.</p>
<p><em>Not perhaps aware of it completely. </em></p>
<p>And even the food, the type of vegetables.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>I mean you probably already heard that already but yeah.</p>
<p><em>Well were setting up a reminiscence session , em reminiscence sessions that the plan, eventually in about three months em…im working with a girl called Yasmin at the em, she works at the national archives. </em></p>
<p>Oh ok.</p>
<p><em>And shes going through the different items I should use for reminiscence sessions, em music, garments, fruits…</em></p>
<p>Cassava is a good one.</p>
<p><em>Cassava’s yeah. Em, the little banana that im struggling to get apparently wood green…</em></p>
<p>Matoki?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>[LAUGHS].</p>
<p><em>So if you know where I can pick up some of those.</em></p>
<p>[BOTH LAUGH].</p>
<p><em>OK so em, in terms of em…the Ugandan asian community or even sort of the Gujarati community would you say its quite a close knit community, growing up round here?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. Em, I think it works in networks so I think em, its not a formally represented thing but the Ugandan Asian community is my dad and the people he knows from his small town where he grew up. You know, there’d be often cases where we’d go Sainsbury’s and see someone from his village who he knew thirty years ago and that, that happened I remember that as a kid and we just find it so remarkable how em, you know our dad would meet someone that he went to primary school with you know, at the leisure centre or something you know, it was just, it was just. It just shows that how many of them I think, came here.</p>
<p><em>Completely. </em></p>
<p>Yeah. Em…and they all you know, many of them live in harrow, a lot of them have lived, have done incredibly well in business here. And live in em, in the prosperous areas of Northwood and XXXX in big homes you know, so they live a very comfortable life. They all lived down the same streets.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>So, that’s….</p>
<p><em>There is that natural…I mean, from my experience in the US as I said earlier a lot of people criticise the Hispanic community for not learning English quick enough. </em></p>
<p>mm.</p>
<p><em>well sort of, to be honest, if you’re living on a street where nine tenths of the people are from the Dominican republic and you speak Spanish, you’re going to speak Spanish. [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><em>I mean, so, I mean, there was still that sense, obviously there was twenty eight thousand seems that em, it seems pretty evenly split between Leicester and London, in terms of the arrivals. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Em, but there also seems to be that relocation as well afterwards, obviously a lot of people arrive XXXX straight to the resettlement camps.</em></p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><em>As you pointed out, refugee camps and then obviously to the next place but there also seems to be, more of a, a second sort of internal migration of Ugandan Asians from what I can tell. </em></p>
<p>Ok. I probably don’t know as much about that, I know that there’s em, there are some in Bristol.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS]. I’ve spent many an hour poring through the census data.</em></p>
<p>[BOTH LAUGH].</p>
<p><em>Surprisingly Ugandan Asian isn’t actually a category on there [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Oh, really yeah.</p>
<p><em>I’ve also realised that it would be have been alot easier to do this project in Leicester aswell. What can I say? </em></p>
<p>Yes. I...one of my father’s sisters lives in Leicester, married in Leicester and lives in Leicester so…yeah. You probably would find far more there, but I…I do think there are a lot in…in…north west London aswell.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it seems to be the spot where they’re located. </em></p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p><em>I was chatting to someone the other day, in an interview but she, wasn’t Ugandan Asian she was from Kenya, she lives on Ealing road and she said that em, a lot of em, the Ugandan Asians when they first left the resettlement camps, a lot of them were set up in north west London anyway but also across London, a lot of them got jobs in the airports. </em></p>
<p>Oh really?</p>
<p><em>So that’s why they congregated on this side. </em></p>
<p>Oh really, yeah?</p>
<p><em>Cos it was just, just closer to the airport.</em></p>
<p>The airport… I know that my dad then, spent his student days, or sort of like when he first , when he was trying to make something of himself, he lived in Wembley…</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Aswell, on the high road with friends, and then, I mean he has some funny stories to tell I think about, cos he was trying to find work here, he hadn’t done, I mean today he’s an accountant, but today if you want to be an accountant you normally have to have done a degree, em he hadn’t done it and I think it was different in those days, but he was also trying to do a sort of em, any sort of business opportunity that he could find, so I think he became a wedding photographer, for a couple of months until he realised it was awful em…not wedding photographer, he’d try and arrange you know all of the wedding décor and everything…</p>
<p><em>Wedding planner…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I think a one man band for everything basically</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Lots of like attempts of like…doing, doing things. XXXX.</p>
<p><em>Entreprenuial spirit.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, which I don’t think, I know that, whilst that is very characteristic, I don’t think he, he himself has opted for being…</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>… a professional and has done very well in that respect.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But em, not not as a business person.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>So he did try the business thing.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But actually ended up being a much, happier, and he really craves that stability. Now, even so, my brother for example is, has, also trained as an accountant and worked in the same firm as my father for a long time, is now setting up his own business left a year ago, but my father had such a difficult time understanding how you could walk away from the potential from being a partner, a senior partner at a good firm…</p>
<p><em>A comfortable…</em></p>
<p>Comfortable, exactly, comfortable, good, professional job, why would you walk away from that to start your own…</p>
<p><em>Do you think that’s a fallout from being a refugee? And perhaps the…</em></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>…turmoil of, being, forced to leave a place and perhaps not knowing where you’re going to go? And what the future held for you?</em></p>
<p>Yep. Exactly. I…really think, I think you can absolutely link the two.</p>
<p><em>And I don’t think that story is unique to your father really, amongst the Ugandan asian community. We’ll go onto that perhaps later, in terms of the success etcetera, em…in terms of, you mentioned your dad’s an accountant I mean, if we go back to Uganda… it seems like the Ugandan asian community were quite unique in terms the society there, and that seems to lead to the eventual problems aswell there, em…</em></p>
<p>mm.</p>
<p><em>they were very much the merchant XXXX class…</em></p>
<p>mm.</p>
<p><em>the entrepreneurial class…</em></p>
<p>yep.</p>
<p><em>And it seemed to fit quite uncomfortably…in terms, especially when Amin came in, and obviously took advantage of these tensions, but I mean, do you think there was tension before Amin over there. Or do you think it was something Amin, sort of played off, do you think there was a pre-existing tension. </em></p>
<p>So, my impression is only based on what I’ve heard from that generation who lived there, its not based on any direct experience but from what I understand, em…I don’t think there was any ever intergration, actually between, the…the sort of white, expats that lived there, the Asians who lived there, and the African community. They, they… did all operate, that’s just how life was there, they didn’t, its not like how it is in London or anything like that, I think everybody did, live very separately so there wasn’t that. What was your question?</p>
<p><em>Well, I mean do you think in terms of…</em></p>
<p>[BOTH LAUGH]</p>
<p><em>In terms of the…the merchant class I mean, that idea of being sort of being expelled and bringing that entreprenial spirit to Britain…</em></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that exisited because of that background and what, their existence was in Uganda.</em></p>
<p>Ok so they set up businesses here because they…</p>
<p><em>Mhm. Because that’s what…</em></p>
<p>Because they had done that there? No, I think that the reason you set up a business is when you haven’t got anything else, when you’re new to a land, you look for opportunity,</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>You don’t necessarily need to have any.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Cos when the Indians first came, when the gujratis came in particular first came to…Uganda, they didn’t…they didn’t have any, they just saw what resources there were in the land that I can basically…exploit. It’s not a nice word, harness to earn a living, and so they spotted opportunities there so that’s more a function of the fact that I’ve come to a new place with nothing.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Em, I’m gonna…and I think to leave, to leave your home country, and your home country to do that for a start and home environment to go and do that for a start, you have to have a willingness to spot opportunities…</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>… from where you are so I think the same thing, but I know that, sort of, our parents generation don’t really encourage entrepreneurial em, activity in our generation.</p>
<p><em>Well, it goes back to the point if your father and your brothers...</em></p>
<p>mmm.</p>
<p><em>its too risky, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And if you’ve got a comfortable set up, you’re part of a firm for example…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Then obvisouly Its, its safe, isn’t it. </em></p>
<p>Exactly. So you do it at, because you have to do it, because there’s nothing else you can do.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>Whereas, that’s not…now we start businesses our generation of businesses we are dissatisfied with being part of you know…</p>
<p><em>Perhaps too comfortable?</em></p>
<p>…the daily grind, well exactly its boring. [LAUGHS]. So em, so that, yeah, so I think its more, I think need drove the business flair.</p>
<p><em>As opposed to some sort of cultural norm, that they inherited… </em></p>
<p>I mean, I do actually think there’s an argument for that aswell, gujaratis are, business people even in the state of Gujarat at the moment, they are, I mean they are, Bombay for example is a city that’s full of gujarati’s and all of them own businesses and shops and products and that’s that’s what they do and any, even the state of Gujarat has grown a lot because of that, I do think that business here, they came here and they, my father can probably talk to you a lot more about this but he thinks that our culture now of having late openings and shops was actually kick started by the Ugandan Asians.</p>
<p><em>I …you certainly wouldn’t be the first person to say that.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>The cornershop idea, the late opening, the Sunday opening, opening on Sundays…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Aswell, people do see it as driven by the Ugandan asian community. </em></p>
<p>Yeah. Which is then replicated by the supermarkets cos they were like…</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Hang on if these guys are opening and we’re open, and that was something which, yeah, so…</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>and all of that is driven by, so I do think there is a kind of like, cultural, not cultural but there is this kind of instinct to..how can we XXXX opportunities….</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>To make money. Which is what an entrepreneur does.</p>
<p><em>Which was then enhanced by, the reality of…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Arriving with nothing. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>As with anything its never that black and white, XXXX many reasons for XXXX.</em></p>
<p>But you can see trends.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>You can see certain patterns.</p>
<p><em>Completely. </em></p>
<p>Em…that exist in that particular type of community. For example, you don’t find many gujratis in the army, they’re not just not those types of people that like to go out, earn lots of money, eat lots of food and enjoy it. Like, to be really crude about it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Whereas people from , of, who are of Punjabi origin tend to be the types who, like the Indian army is full of them so… you know, you do get…</p>
<p><em>Yeah certainly.</em></p>
<p>…certain characteristics.</p>
<p><em>It’s a horrible perspective to have isn’t but, its… we’re talking about cultural norms here or about cultural stereotype but there’s also the argument that there’s no smoke without fire. You know… [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Yeah…</p>
<p><em>It’s the reality sometimes. Em, I can certainly say that being from irish descent I know which members of my family are more inclined to drink.</em></p>
<p>Yeah [LAUGHS].</p>
<p><em>That’s defiantly irish. [LAUGHS]. Cultural stereotypes…boxed in. Em, in terms of your, I mean, we’ve kinda looked at this, in terms of your identity you are very much British. </em></p>
<p>mm.</p>
<p><em>you feel British. Can you tell me how you felt when you went back to Uganda for the documentary, was that the first time you… </em></p>
<p>No…</p>
<p><em>I say go back…?</em></p>
<p>No, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Was that first time you’ve gone?</em></p>
<p>I initially went actually, just because I wanted to break free from the newsroom to be honest and I had the opportunity to go with a friend, who’s English, but em, her father lived in Uganda, and we managed to get a grant so we thought which former commonwealth country should we go to and she had a strong desire to go Uganda so that was really the only reason. I had absolutely no desire to go there I don’t associate with, associate with it in anyway apart from vague em, knowledge that I had that my father had came from there. And literally it was that.</p>
<p><em>As you said earlier, you know…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>The odd tit bit. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>That odd anecdote that you heard your dad make reference to, but apart from that.</em></p>
<p>To which we would quickly…sort of you know,</p>
<p>LAUGHS</p>
<p>Say oh, quickly or god here we go again. So em, so actually it was really by chance and it was there when I saw. There is an Indian community there now and they are the few that went back who were invited back in the nineteen eighties, em, and I, that’s when I was amazed and I could suddenly visualise what was life like here. Actually its pretty good like, sunshine every day, amazing food.</p>
<p><em>Pearl of Africa is what it was always referred to wasn’t it? </em></p>
<p>What’s that?</p>
<p><em>The pearl of Africa.</em></p>
<p>Pearl of Africa, yeah exactly. Em, so…so that only then did that spark an intrigue with me to want to, to explore more, who is, what is this community, you know what was my dad’s life like? My families life like. So, it was there that I then I had the idea to do something and develop this idea of a documentary, so really unless I’d been there, I wouldn’t have, and then I returned to do the documentary.</p>
<p><em>Mhm, so…I mean…</em></p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p><em>It seems that it just awakened the sense…</em></p>
<p>Mhm.</p>
<p><em>…for you to find out more perhaps, not, well yeah your heritage suppose and your story.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did you, find the answers to which you were looking for? In terms of…</em></p>
<p>Em…</p>
<p><em>…the process of making the documentary, the people you met, reflecting obviously speaking to your family members. </em></p>
<p>Mhm.</p>
<p><em>Who then perhaps told you things, as you say quite blissfully ignorant of in the past. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>I mean do you think it has given you, a more in depth knowledge of your identity, and where you’re from?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Absolutely it’s definitely given clarity on certain things, I definitely feel that I can take a much big picture view of, of me and my generation and the way we are, and the way we look at things and actually how we in some ways look at things a bit differently so…I think it definitely gave me that kind of, broader perspective, em, of seeing how, so many of the things I’ve been influenced by have been influenced by my parents , or like my father in particular who has, his life and his upbringing there that I’d previously not been aware of.</p>
<p><em>Mhm .So…was there em, did you feel any sort of perhaps, perhaps a sense of injustice, but did you picture yourself there, perhaps if the expulsion XXXX taken place cos the fact of the matter is you may have been born in Uganda, it could have been your home. Did you-</em></p>
<p>Yeah…I mean haven’t , I haven’t actually contemplated that to be honest erm, Uganda potentially having been my home…erm…y’know Uganda is such a peaceful country right now , in part, certainly in the south and the capital. I mean throughout the country right now there is peace and erm, it’s a-it’s a really safe country and you just- you can’t really imagine it, you just, you just, you just can’t. And I can see now how, any Indians over there are doing very well erm, I’m making a lot of money from business- I actually saw a lot of opportunity, I actually thought gosh [laughs] I could really live a good life-</p>
<p><em>Is this your entrepreneurial spirit? </em></p>
<p>Laughs.</p>
<p><em>Laughs.</em></p>
<p>I did, I mean I really, if there, if there, if…the people I was close to were willing to, to do that, I can, I can actually, I’d be quite happy to give it a go, living out there. Erm…</p>
<p><em>Have you told your husband this? [Laughs]</em></p>
<p>Yeah- he grew up in Nigeria so-</p>
<p><em>Okay, right.</em></p>
<p>-so he’s also growing up in, in the African continent, [<em>yeah</em>] it’s not something so alien to him. But yeah, I mean…yeah I mean, it made it much more real. Erm…how- I don’t know, what was the question again?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that makes sense</em>. [Laughs] <em>In terms of erm, you mentioned the Asian community that lives [Mmm] you mentioned that only so many go back, not great numbers [</em>yeah, no<em>] but there was some invited by the- was it the President that replaced Amin?</em></p>
<p>Ye- well there was a few in between but yeah, Museveni is the current President , yeah.</p>
<p><em>So, erm, can you- it-it seems- has it gone back to XXXX? I mean are the Asian community there, Gujarati community of the merchant class again?</em></p>
<p>Mmm, yeah erm, I- so there are, there are also… now Ugandan business people there [<strong>clears throat</strong>] and also erm, I think Uganda’s moved on a lot, I think that people are quite keen to- Ugandan’s by nature are very- they’re a very good natured people and erm, I, y’know, it was a, it was a, it was Idi Amin who drove a lot of this, erm…I can’t imagine, I don’t think there are tensions bubbling under the surface now-</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>- I really don’t. I think people live quite happily together, erm [<strong>coughs</strong>], I think- sorry-</p>
<p><em>No, is it sensible only for the mistakes or is it just the world’s moved on, Uganda’s moved on [</em>yeah<em>], perhaps from that tension. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, I don’t think- I-I think everyone sees that it was not in the country’s best interests, for that to have happened. Erm, and no one would want that to happen again and I also feel that there’s not that many Asians there-I-I don’t know what it was like, but certainly how it was described- it-it- I don’t think it’s like that now.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I mean do you still have anywhere there are-there are in- there’s also now a massive influx of Indians from India [<em>yeah</em>] who are starting from much, much lower down-</p>
<p><em>From scratch.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. But the ones who’ve gone back, who were of that- the generation who’d already salvaged themselves there- are generally doing quite well there.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm. And I mean- it seems that- I mean- in terms of s- you find that if a community’s segregated or a society’s segregated, as you described it would be [</em>mmm<em>] some of the British colonial powers-</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>-the Africans and also [</em>yeah<em>] the Gujarati Asians. I mean the reality is, when you do find there’s a sense of segregation… the i- the potential for scapegoating is always increased, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And also the numbers tend to be exaggerated because if you see a block of- if you walk down the street and the entire street is Ugandan Asian, then you sort of- you swell the numbers in your head. You think it’s really segregated and they’re getting bigger-</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>- so if they are more integrated and nowadays I can imagine there’s a potential obviously</em> [yeah] <em>XXXX there and it was,</em> [yeah] <em>you know what I mean? And of course if you have Amin to the equation, which is a quite unique, character in itself</em> [yeah, yeah] <em>I mean if you talk about some political populism, he sort of took it onto the next level-</em></p>
<p>Yeah [<strong>laughs</strong>].</p>
<p><em>He did! Completely mental [<strong>laughs</strong>].</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Do you erm, in terms of erm, the story you got from Uganda</em> [mmm]<em>, peoples’ perspectives, is there any remorse amongst the African community of what happened? The people you spoke to?</em></p>
<p>See I don’t think people themselves feel like they… they weren’t [<em>to blame</em>] Idi Amin’s decisions- yeah, so it wasn’t- it was sort of like- it wasn’t like they all kind of really like, erm, fought for the Ugandan- the, the Ugandan Asians to leave-</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>-erm I don’t get a sense of any- I mean I didn’t- as a, as an Asian walking around, interacting with the local people, I just felt like everybody was- like it really wasn’t an issue [<em>mm-hm</em>] and the past has really been put behind.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Erm…sorry just one thing I just really want to say actually about the really thing- the thing that really struck me is erm, I mean, so there’s an example of a guy called Sudhir Ruparelia who erm, was one of the ones who came in my Father’s generation, back here, and, and he, he was one of those who went back, when they were invited back and he owns probably, half of the country! Erm he…so he here was never really able to settle, he was a sort of taxi driver-</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>-er m, again he lived in Kenton erm, and then- and never really- he never really got on with life here very well so he took the opportunity to go back and has, has just done remarkably well from a, from a business standpoint.</p>
<p>Mm-hm.</p>
<p>Erm, own hotels, banks, erm… created this massive resort which enabled Uganda to host the African Union meeting one-one year and y’know just so many- he’s-he’s-he’s-</p>
<p><em>Fingers in many pies.</em></p>
<p>What’s that?</p>
<p><em>Fingers in many-</em></p>
<p>Fingers in so many! I mean yeah, everybody knows him in Uganda- everybody knows his name, he’s quite notorious. Erm, but it just- I just had no idea that people- well here- previous to going out there, I had no idea that some had gone back and it- are doing things in a country you can never imagine doing in the UK.</p>
<p><em>Here, yeah.</em></p>
<p>Cos erm, it just- you know again, just creating- they just created so many opportunities for themselves I guess.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm. It’s I mean it’s-it’s such a different arrival story, isn’t it, from an economic migrant [</em>mmm<em>] who had to- kinda been forced to XXXX-</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>-it’s- you know obviously it does change your motivation to succeed</em> [yeah] <em>or also it hampers your ability to succeed if you’re a refugee.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>I mean, as an economic migrant, if you’re a different ethnicity, speak a different language, you pretty much start at the bottom anyway. If you’re a refugee, you’re even- you’re below the bottom.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>Laughs</strong>] You’re digging your way through the pit. Erm, in terms of…erm… the fortieth anniversary, which is obviously why we are doing this project [</em>mmm<em>], erm, I mean, how do you feel it should be celebrated? I mean we have discussed obviously off the recording device [</em>mmm<em>], about- there seems to be this fear of this gap of awareness [yeah] of the next generation.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>I mean how do you think it should be celebrated and also how do think you can educate people of perhaps in your generation, or the generation beyond of this unique story?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. I mean I wonder how much interest there is cos I feel like this is- it’s a very…erm, I think the story of the Ugandan Asians is relevant to, the whole of Britain, if we look at how THE Ugandan Asians- what influence have they had on the way Britain functions and operates today. And so one example is what we discussed earlier, which was the all hours opening times- I don’t think many people know that that’s something that may have been quite heavily influenced by Ugandan Asians. So I think it would be really good to somehow generate awareness of what impact have Ugandan Asians as a community had on erm, things which are the norm today, in everyday life, in Britain. Cos that therefore makes it relevant to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>Erm, but I do think it’s really important to know where you come from, from, from a very specific- as a Ugandan Asian second generation. Mainly I see erm, a lot of frustration in my generation, people who are trapped in jobs that they don’t really enjoy and are too afraid to do anything different and I do think that, that this entrepreneurial streak – so this again, this is very much my belief, erm, that is inherent in Guajaratis and specifically those ones that migrated. I do think it’s in our blood to-to do that and to- we’ll feel much happier when we are expressing ourselves through doing business.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm.</em></p>
<p>It was something where your- that I do think that- that’s where we feel fulfilled. I’m generalising hugely here.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>Erm, but and-and a lot of people who would like to- and I know they would like to- y’know they’re hitting their sort of- they’re in their late twenties, early thirties, and would love to do something but are- are too afraid.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm.</em></p>
<p>Er, because they’ve had the sheltered upbringing, the comfort. So I think-</p>
<p><em>So, the double edge- it’s a bit sweet sort of aspect isn’t it? </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>That this comfort has been provided [</em>yeah<em>]. But at the same time that’s perhaps taken-</em></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><em>-that sort of entrepreneurial aspect, or even that sort of-</em></p>
<p>Fearlessness to do something.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, to take risks.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, to take risks real- I really do think that. And what going to Uganda certainly helped me realise erm, [<strong>clears throat</strong>] was that the, the ones who were there, the ones who’ve gone back, they XXXX the younger generation- there’s very few- but the ones who’ve gone back there have tak- have gone out of their comfort zone, have done things which they never thought they’d be able to do. And are living more enriching and fulfilled lives as a result, rather than just having a conventional job in a bank here or whatever it may be. Y’know they’ve got a good degree, they’re p- training to do the right thing, the good thing that their parents may have-</p>
<p><em>What is expected of them.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly yeah. Erm, bitter therefore. It-it opened my eyes to what’s possible and actually, y’know look at what my forefathers did and are capable of [yeah] and erm, could I potentially do the same. If I don’t know about that, if I didn’t even know that I’d come from that then I’d just think I'm the same as everyone else exactly. And there’s a remarkable strength of character that erm, runs in my blood, that I don’t know about- that kind of thing. So I think those are the things that erm, are beneficial and-and should be shared and that those are the things that would- are of relevance to the young generation, rather than just hearing about this constant struggle- we went through this, we went through that- cos that actually gets a bit tiresome as, as insensitive as that sounds.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm.</em></p>
<p>We don’t constantly need to hear about it and no one really wants to go on about how- even the- them themselves-</p>
<p><em>What good does it actually do [</em>exactly<em>], I mean you have to be aware but it doesn’t have to be, y’know, such a massive facet of your identity [</em>no] <em>especially if you can use it in a negative construct as well.</em></p>
<p>I think so, yeah. Erm, I think, but I think it can serve- I-I know that for-for peers who I've spoken to, or who-who may have heard of that documentary- for them they really felt it opened their eyes and couldn’t know them- I didn’t-I’ve never really thought about what my parents went through, what they may have done in their previous [<em>mmm</em>]- what they went through to-to get to the stage where they’re at now. Erm, and, just that, yeah so it’s more of a kind of- yeah.</p>
<p><em>I think that’s, I mean, to be honest, that’s the sort of erm, disease of most us, our generation- it’s not necessarily- I mean the fact that your parents went through such a or-ordeal [</em>mmm<em>], such a process anyway, and then managed to sort of like, rise up from sort of the ashes [</em>mmm-mmm<em>] to start again- I think it’s more pre- I think it’s- not something specific to second generation Ugandan Asians [no] I think this is a problem with society- we never actually looked into our parents’ eyes and think well they did sort of d-</em></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>Where did they come- how did they get to this point? What process did they go through? [</em>Yeah<em>] What battles did they fight? Erm, but I say is it more important perhaps as, you know as the second generation of a refugee group? Erm you’ve gone- I mean you’ve kind of touched on this and- these are the last two questions on the topic we’re going to talk about. Erm, yeah you’ve obviously gauged the reaction of your peers, [</em>mmm<em>] your peer groups, if you can generalise on the- what was it, was that- suddenly a re-awareness or something that happened that never happened- they never really think of or- what kind of reactions were there amongst your peer group?</em></p>
<p>I mean quite honestly, I think there is still- even if you tell a lot of people- a lot of people just aren’t interested unfortunately, I-I really feel that there are- I mean, so like my-my first cousin, her Mother is the one I interviewed in the documentary, who has been most open about her experiences- her and her- and- so my cousin’s Father- my aunts and uncles have been so op- they when asked can be very open and er, have the most amazing things to say about their experiences of the expulsion and being refuges here. But I know that my cousin has absolutely zero interest- she’s an intelligent girl, y’know she works for Barclay Card Enterprise [<em>mmm</em>] and they Enterprise division as, y’know, she’s- there’s nothing that- she’s not- it’s not that she’s not intelligent [<em>mmm</em>] but she has absolutely no interest.</p>
<p><em>She’s chosen to be ignorant on that subject.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and-and I think that is- and I can’t and I- in that she’s the daughter so that’s-that’s her parents we’re talking [<em>yeah</em>] about. I mean I’m interested in their story- she’s not that interested in their story and I- I just think that there’s- I mean I don’t know what- I don’t really know why it is but there is, there is a lot of erm…apathy I guess is the right word. Erm, but among, amongst the ones who have delved a little bit, who have taken the time- I think it’s a matter of-of creating a mental space to want to know a bit about-</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>-erm, that the ones who have, I think have been, have been quite deeply affected by it.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm.</em></p>
<p>I know, so I know of this one set of siblings , which is the ones I mentioned to you- the Duwalas, who their parents I know had a lot of- were-were very nostalgic about their life in Uganda. Erm, really missed it, erm, and therefore they tried to- so that the eldest son, who’s maybe in his mid thirties now, has gone back to Uganda and has-has-has been setting up various businesses there. Erm, then followed by his younger sister, who’s in her mid twenties erm, who’s set up an organisation called Experience Uganda which is specifically like a tour operating company, to take expelled, erm, Ugandans back to visit their…yeah…</p>
<p><em>Really interesting concept.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I mean it’s a bit niche, but- so I think it’s-</p>
<p><em>I don’t think</em> [<strong>laughs</strong>] <em>there’s that much potential to expand [<strong>laughs</strong>].</em></p>
<p>No, but erm it was a really good- so they did a couple of trips and actually she’s the one who I wanted to put you in touch with and I know she’s in London at the moment. Erm, her and her older brother I think are still based most of the time in Uganda but they’re in- they live in Watford, erm, so their parents also resettled, so the whole family actually went and resettled but now I know that the youngest sister missed London and the UK and hasn’t really found her feet there and has come back here now [okay], erm, so she’s definitely rooted herself back in the UK [<em>mm-hm</em>]. The parents after making this decision to go back and emigrate to Uganda again, also hasn’t really worked out for them, [<em>really?</em>] they’ve come back to Watford, yes, they’ve gone full circle.</p>
<p><em>What, I mean, what sort of- how long were they over here, obviously expelled in sort of early seventies,’72-</em></p>
<p>So they would have gone- they went at the time of the expulsion- ’72, and then, erm, stayed here until a couple of years ago [<em>wow</em>], so they’ve spent nearly forty years here-</p>
<p><em>It’s a large amount of time, isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s hard so that- and then they’ve gone back to try and- but they had such fond memories and clearly that’s influenced their kids to the extent that their eldest son was the one that drove the decision to go back.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>Their second daughter is the one who set up Experience Uganda and arranged a lot of these trips for- actually I should have put you in touch with her first she’s- [<em>no problem</em>] she’s the one who erm-</p>
<p><em>You told me about her now, she sounds like an amazing individual.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. XXXX so she’s the one who erm- and she’s very erm, linked in to where the Ugan- and I know has organised events in Leicester aswell and really got groups together and… I know it was a really emotional experience for the groups that she did get together to take over…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hm.</em></p>
<p>…to Uganda on tours.</p>
<p><em>Would love to be a fly on the wall in that situation [<strong>laughs</strong>].</em></p>
