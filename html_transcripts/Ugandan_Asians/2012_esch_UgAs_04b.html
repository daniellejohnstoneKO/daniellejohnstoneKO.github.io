<p><em>OK carry on…</em></p>
<p>So I put, I, I arranged the job for my brother and…made sure that he got a job and then he started, to…put in his application. So then he took in…em, they had something called er, L - one visa’s which are for training purposes.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And that he had language skills.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And because this particular guy was manufacturing garments. And most of his garments would come from India.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And he’d need somebody that could speak the language, so that’s how I, how he got in…a job.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And secondly…he was able to give that, as a reason for trying to stay on.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…erm, and two man power and whatever, whatever… XXXX he had unique qualifications and he…</p>
<p><em>Is it speaking gu - Gujarati?</em></p>
<p>Yeah he speaks Guajarati, he speaks em, Hindi and…yeah.</p>
<p><em>Do you speak both of them as well?</em></p>
<p>I do, ya, I speak both them, I speak enough Japanese to get by…</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS]</em></p>
<p>…because I work with a Japanese bank as well, so ya…</p>
<p><em>You’ve picked up a lot of languages…</em></p>
<p>That’s right. Swahili…a little bit, I mean it’s very, very rusty. Cos there’s….</p>
<p><em>And they speak er…in Uganda? What do they speak?</em></p>
<p>Swahili.</p>
<p><em>Swahili in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>But then you and em, each state, or each county had their own language.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>…as well, so but, I can’t speak that because I, I don’t think there was enough practice xxx you can meet some Ugandans or meet some Kenyans, they all speak…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>...little bit of Tanzania’s they speak Swahili.</p>
<p><em>Did you have any other relatives, um…else…that scattered after, after , after the…ex- expulsion did they go anywhere else? You‘re immediate family obviously went to UK.</em></p>
<p>We came to UK. Some of my maternal uncles went to Canada… one XXXX to Australia.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em> <em>Did they, so they didn’t have British passports, British citizen…</em></p>
<p>They did, but I think there was also po - potential that they would be taken.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>So…in my case of my uncle, his brother, was in Canada so he said OK why do you have to, you know why don’t you come to Canada?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And there were, er, saying that OK we’ll two thousand or we’ll take one thousand or we’ll take five hundred people.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So…And US wanted only qualified people.</p>
<p><em>OK. </em></p>
<p>Er…Australia was similar. So…whoever could get. I mean, and those that completely, were stateless.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Well they’d never knew whether they belonged here of there. They went to places like Malta.</p>
<p><em>Really.</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Malta, Denmark.</p>
<p><em>Scandinavia, Sweden perhaps?</em></p>
<p>Ya. Ya, ya, ya. So there is a Diaspora in Sweden.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Not as big as UK?</em></p>
<p>No. I think UK by far the largest, I mean in…. in any terms XXXX. If you look at anybody, I think you’ll find that UK probably holds the most.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>Because, again, the reason for that is that, even if you looked to Africa, so the French, West Africa, were the francophone countries and then the English speaking. So all the people with English speaking find it easier because they can communicate.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And then when you come here…you’ve got that little bit of…</p>
<p>And you got that, you know, advantage, you got that support, you got medical support. That’s what I’m saying to you, so this country truly, truly, does give care…and they do want to give, you know, make sure that you have the opportunities to do the best that you possibly can.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So there’s plenty.</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS].</em> <em>Thank you.</em></p>
