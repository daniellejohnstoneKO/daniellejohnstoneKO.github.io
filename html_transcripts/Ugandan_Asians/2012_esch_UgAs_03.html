<h3 id="phone-rings-excuse-me">[phone rings] excuse me</h3>
<h3 id="yes-of-course"><em>Yes of course</em></h3>
<p><em>So yeah when Eddie Amin came in did you know that he was coming?</em></p>
<p>No we didn’t know he was coming. It was just a surprise visit.</p>
<p><em>And he turned up with all his, his army?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>How scary was that?</em></p>
<p>Very scary it was, but it happened so fast that the later feeling was quite comfortable, you know. As nothing had happened so we were quite, quite happy that nothing had happened.</p>
<p><em>Hmm, were people very scared of him?</em></p>
<p>Yes, they were all scared of him. Everyone, during his power, very scarred. Because err, we often heard stories where he would arrest ministers, or anyone who’s not on his side. They would be arrest, tortured and sometimes even killed.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, so did you know anyone that had, that had happened to?</em></p>
<p>No, not personally that I err, that not that personally I know, knew anyone. But we often use to her hear stories about, even when I was so young. Err we use to hear these kind of things because we had to be very safe, err as to where we go, up to what time we go, and when we come back home. For our safety.</p>
<p><em>Hmm, your mother must have been petrified.</em></p>
<p>Mothers are always petrified, whether Eddie Amin was in power or not. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>So did you see things change when he was in power?</em></p>
<p>Things changed yes, but not for good, things changed for worse. Erm, since err, his army use to loot a lot of shop keepers. They use to visit shops almost every so often whenever they needed money or goods you they would just come and take it.</p>
<p><em>So that happened to your Father a lot?</em></p>
<p>My Father was a very calm loving person. And he believed in God.,And god that will protect him. We were pretty safe. Nothing had happened to us. As to any harassment, or, no nothing like that.</p>
<p><em>Was it a shock when Eddie Amin told everyone to leave?</em></p>
<p>It was a shock for those people who had no money, and they didn’t know where to go. Yes it was shock. But for those who had British passports and they knew that they could come here. Since most people were in connected with United Kingdom, they knew what they were coming to.</p>
<p><em>Cos you weren’t given long to get out, were you?</em></p>
<p>We were given ninety days only. And during those ninety days, your documents had to be prepared, we have experienced err, long, long, it was like a second world war. Situation in Uganda, everything was rushing. Military check points everywhere. Err, if you had any money, which you would because you had to buy tickets, or you had to buy you know food. You know, while you are waiting in the queue, and this money sometimes were taken away by the check points. We didn’t experience this, like I said God was always with us, yeah, we didn’t experience, but a car in front of us, it happened to that car once I remember. But not to us.</p>
<p><em>What actually happened to the car in front?</em></p>
<p>He just asked err this person to come out. They checked his wallet, you know. And err, I remember a lady came out from the car as well, almost everybody came out but there was a lady in the car and the army men was going all over, you know touching, this women. And it was nothing the men could do or we could to help, you could only pray that they would be safe, left alone, quickly and, that they would let them go. And that's what happened, but they took the wallet. Complete wallet. Yes.</p>
<p><em>So what happened? Did your father- was he able to get anything out of the country? Was he-</em></p>
<p>My father was an honest man, like I say he was very Godly, he’d never sent money out of the country like many Asians did, and therefore he did not have any money overseas. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So you had ninety days to get out and erm, could you take anything with you?</em></p>
<p>We were allowed to take only fifty pounds, English money.</p>
<p><em>Right and-</em></p>
<p>B-Both family.</p>
<p><em>And that included all of your extended family or just, your father-</em></p>
<p>Per family, not per person. My father was allowed to take fifty pounds.</p>
<p><em>So you had to leave the whole business behind.</em></p>
<p>Yes, we had to leave the whole business behind, yeah.</p>
<p><em>So where, when did you know you were coming to the UK?</em></p>
<p>We didn’t come to the UK, like I said I’m not British Citizen. I’m a Netherlands. From there, because we were Ugandan citizens, we were Ugandan Asian; we did not have British Passport. So we were in a dilemma, either we go to India, or we go to contraries that are sponsoring, to take certain professional Asians from Uganda. And err it was a very hard choice. I had an opportunity to go to Switzerland, also to Canada. But my father wasn’t, and I wanted to stick with the family, so I gave up those two chances, and we stick together. We were searching for a possible sponsor to take us somewhere, out of, out of Uganda. We did not want to go to India because we did not know anybody there. And we had heard that the Europeans are very helpful, and most of our families were coming to United Kingdom. So maybe it will be easier for us to go to Europe and then maybe in future con, reconnect to our families . And that's what we did. Err we had a sponsor err, to take us to Austria, in the world’s biggest refugee camp. We settled in Austria as refugees. Within days, the Dutch ,the Swedish, the Finnish, German, Belgium, Luxemburg, all these countries came to, take certain amount of Asian people from this particular camp. Again they did not err, discriminate whether it should be professional or non professional or disable or it didn’t matter to them. It was completely on a humanitarian ground that they will take us. And err, we decided, that we would go to Netherlands. Looking at the map, Netherlands was not too far from United Kingdom and that they spoke English. Err very well, and we thought and we felt since it was a personal invitation from the queen herself, in those days it was queen Juliana, erm in Netherlands. Her majesty was absolutely kind. And the delegation was given specific instructions how to treat us. What to do with us. That they would feel proud, that Netherlands, the Dutch people would feel really proud that they have helped somebody and that they’ve honoured somebody, and they’ve honoured their own queen, in such a way that they’ve treated us with dignity. So we came to the country, they gave us home, clothes, money, jobs. Whatever that was necessary that was given to us straight away. Yes. We came during the winter time, so not only the delegation at that, but the Dutch people themselves, came along and offered us help, take us to there homes, try teach us their language, try and teach us what they err do, how they live. Even find us jobs. You know in many cases, they become really part of our families. Yes. And err, eventually we managed to come to United Kingdom, because the- England joined the EC, it wasn’t then, the restrictions were taken away.</p>
<p><em>So how long were you in the refugee camp for?</em></p>
<p>Only for a few days.</p>
<p><em>What was it like in the refugee camp?</em></p>
<p>Err my memory... it was not very good. For many people, because I can remember one of the richest man in Uganda who had, erm, erm, very big business there, was with as a refugee. Had nothing at all. And erm, we were taken away from this particular camp, to err, brought to another camp. And over there we were given rooms, individual rooms, err we had special kitchen where we could cook our own food, but for the community not individual. Yes, whatever you do you had to do it for the community, the whole community that was that. In the camp people were trying to give us some clothes. Some food or whatever, whoever came to give something, there were, people were jumping for it, as if they never seen anything like that before. And to see one of these rich men, a business man to behave like that was shocking. You know. That was shocking. We, we were not really like that, we were just waiting for our turn, always discipline that we were told not to rush by our father. Just relax. What will come to you, will come to you. And err, obviously waited for things to happen, we had the best, always the best. Yes, people could see this, people are not rushing, so they would come say look take this.</p>
<p><em>So how much were you allowed to take with you, fifty pounds and what just a suitcase?</em></p>
<p>Even the suitcase in our, in our case nothing was taken away, but in many cases some of the suitcases were taken by the, by the, by the err check points. Armies you know. Some could bring something, some people could not bring anything you know. In our case we had some of clothes. Short sleeve shirts and light trousers, you know. It wasn’t enough. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So you went to, where about in Holland did you go to?</em></p>
<p>We were taken to Amsterdam, oh yes were given also special tour by the queen. For the, for the, countries of major cities in the country. We were taken in the buses, the trams, and trains. They showed us the country within days. Where we, we were, where we were coming to live. Yes.</p>
<p><em>So did they give you accommodation in Amsterdam?</em></p>
<p>That they gave us a little, we were first brought into a camp again, because they were not ready for us. They took very impulsive decision; err to take fifty families, not fifty people, fifty families. Err could be family for just two or family in our case for ten you know, but fifty. We were taken to a camp first and from that camp each individual was given a place in a different place. It was then very well organised by them, because they did not want us to live together. They wanted us to learn to emancipate with the society, which I think the British made the mistake when the Asian came here. They were sent to all one particular place like Leicester and err Southall at the time you know. And the rest, the Dutch people sent us all into different places. Sometimes we were miles away from each other, you know.</p>
<p><em>Did that make you feel alienated at all?</em></p>
<p>No it was for the benefit for of our own self. You know, it was, acceptable. We were not scarred because we initially we were very welcomed, well hearted. And err we did not feel anything like that no.</p>
<p><em>And what was the accommodation like that they gave you?</em></p>
<p>Brand new flats, brand new furniture, brand new curtains. Brand new err, kitchen err utensils. Everything brand new. Brand new carpets. Brand new bed. You know.</p>
<p><em>Your dad made the right choice didn’t he?</em></p>
<p>Yes, he made a right choice. But it was not just with us, we hear then wherever people went in Europe they were given a similar treatment. They all had fantastic treatment. They all settled down, very well in Europe.</p>
<p><em>So what, what job was your given? Was he given a job or-</em></p>
<p>When he left Uganda then he did not work err, at all. He was mainly a representative of the fifty Uganda families with the Dutch government, and he became err, like a service man, you know. To the Asians, the Ugandan Asians in Netherlands, he will be present for any problems or translations or any, any other, he was like a minister. Yes.</p>
<p><em>That's great, so what did you do in Holland?</em></p>
<p>Well I came first in Holland I started looking for a job. And err, they were going to find me a job, but luckily when I s- I said they’ve done so much for us I think its also our duty to see if we can err, get up and look for jobs ourselves. Which I did. I went in one of the offices and somebody there spoke English, because I did not speak Dutch at all at the time. Only I picked up a few words to say thank-you good-bye and err, hello, you know. The guy tried to help me in translation, and he realised that I will not get a job there, but he said I think I know where I can get you a job. So he took me to one particular insurance company. And the insurance company saw this as a fantastic opportunity for them, to come into the media. Because we were very much in the media at the time in the Dutch national news paper and everywhere. You know, especially my father. Yeah he was almost every day in the newspaper. [Laughs]</p>
<p><em>Was he really?</em></p>
<p>For one reason or the other.</p>
<p><em>What did he do, I mean-</em></p>
<p>For helping mostly the Ugandan people in the Dutch government, err, he became a media between the two, and err, he was, he done a good job for many people. I am proud of my dad. Yes. and err yes this guy took me to this particular place and err without an interview [laughs] even though I don’t speak Dutch, I don’t write Dutch, I was given a job, and the next thing, I had all these newspaper guys coming into the office taking my pictures you know, and asking me this and that, like what are you doing now, you know, it was like err, like a hero. [Laughs] Yes I was in the newspaper again, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Right were you married at this time?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yeah.</p>
<p><em>So your wife was-</em></p>
<p>Also yes.</p>
<p><em>Did she work at all?</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no, so how long were you in insurance, in, in, Holland?</em></p>
<p>I worked there for six months, I was frustrated because I could not write, or speak that much, I had like almost twenty, thirty by then, err, I was a fast learner, to learn languages, because in Africa we spoke quite a African languages, native languages, so naturally we were, [phone rings] excuse me.</p>
