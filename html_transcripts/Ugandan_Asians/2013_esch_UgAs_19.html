I have not lost anything so what I can say what he did was wrong for sure for everybody. I think if he wouldn’t have made the decision in those days then Uganda today would be better than South Africa, because the Asian would have brought it all the way, even now we are still here and when you go there you find the Asian are hard working people, and today Uganda needs hard working people even today. Now officially they are inviting everybody, they did invite people back from here and from India some are going some are not going and I think he made a mistake, if he was sitting here I would say to him you have made a big mistake.
