<p><em>Ok, can I ask you for your full name please?</em></p>
<p>Ashifa Dhillon.</p>
<p><em>Can you spell that for me please?</em></p>
<p>A S H I F A Dhillon, D H I double L O N.</p>
<p><em>That’s perfect. And can I ask you date of birth, if you don’t mind giving me that?</em></p>
<p>Well, I’m still sixty five young [laughs].</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Fifteen, nine, nineteen forty seven (1947).</p>
<p><em>Forty Seven (1947). And I’m still twenty nine [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Um, can you tell me the place of birth, where you…</em></p>
<p>Masaka, Uganda, Africa.</p>
<p><em>And where is that in Uganda, geographically speaking, is it in the North, the South…</em></p>
<p>Uganda is in er, er, South East Uganda, South East, oh gosh! [laughs].</p>
<p><em>Well, not Uganda itself, Masaka the actual place, where in terms of Uganda was that?</em></p>
<p>Masaka is, er, South I think, I’m not sure.</p>
<p><em>In the South, ok xxxx. Um, can I ask um, whether you could possibly describe Masaka to me, um, you know, what kind of environment did you get brought up in?</em></p>
<p>Ok, er, my, when my dad was born in nineteen oh six (1906) in India, er, he came to Africa and then he settled in Masaka. When he settled in Masaka it was only a small village, and he used to tell us that there were no toilets. There was no water and er, there were very, very few people and one or two Asians here, he was one of the, one of the three Asians. And I’m one of eleven children, and all eleven children are born in Masaka.</p>
<p><em>So you’re quite a big family?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, big family, yes.</p>
<p><em>So he went from being only three Indians, to xxxx [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>That’s right, but later on there were loads. And um, there were three schools, one, one of them was XXXX Khan School, Indian School, and er, public school. There were three schools there. Um…there were a lot of different communities er, such as the smiley’s, er, the Guajarati’s, the Hindus, er, Muslims, Sikhs. And we also grew up a lot with mixed race, because a lot of Asian people when they went there, during the time of the railways, they got married to black Africans. And we grew up with their children as well.</p>
<p><em>Ok, so it was quite a mixed community?</em></p>
<p>It was a very mixed community. It was quite nice, it was very, very nice, it was like a little home to everybody. Everyone knew everyone, and we could drop in to each others houses, but one thing I remember, if we did anything naughty, any of the neighbours would tell us off. And our parents would appreciate that. Er, they would appreciate that very much. And they would er, sort of, make sure that we listened to our neighbours, or whoever complained about us, because they meant well for us.</p>
<p><em>Hm hm, so a real community there…</em></p>
<p>It was, yes.</p>
<p><em>People seemed to look after eachother?</em></p>
<p>They did, yes, they did. And, we had to respect everybody, I mean growing up with er, er, different faiths, with different cultures, with the different er, backgrounds, we were taught to respect everyone who was older than us. And today, I know certain people who were my mum’s age and my dad, and my dad’s age, I didn’t know their names, I used to call them uncle and aunties. But I knew who they were.</p>
<p><em>Of course. So, tight knit community. </em></p>
<p>Very tight knit.</p>
<p><em>And er, can you perhaps um, describe um, sort of the layout of the town, was it I don’t know, you said it was quite a small town…</em></p>
<p>It was a small town, it had three streets, or four streets. Er, when I was growing up, now I understand it’s quite a big town. And it had a post office, it had er, Barclays Bank, it had Gringley’s (?) Bank, um…it had a big ground, but what amazed me was, and I used to question my father and he had no answer for that. Or maybe he didn’t want me to know, want us to know, they, they were three areas, er, there was er, European area, only Europeans stayed there. And then there was Asian area, only Asians stayed there. And then there were African areas, and these were the areas that were really started by the British.</p>
<p><em>So the British obviously had…</em></p>
<p>Segregated them.</p>
<p><em>They segregate society. </em></p>
<p>Segregated society. And this was in that little town and I used to wonder why they have got this area, why their houses are so different than ours. Um, and it used to amaze me, because they used to be a lot of teachers who were inspectoring teachers, who used to come in to the schools from maybe er, Puerto Rica, Goa, which is in, Portuguese Goa, and from Scotland, we used to have a lot of teachers from Scotland. Xxxx I used to er, um, they used to do Geography, History with us. So it was quite er, er, different way of …</p>
<p><em>Yeah, quite a unique upbringing. </em></p>
<p>Yes, very unique. Anyway, it was very good…</p>
<p><em>And anyway, let’s talk about school…</em></p>
<p>Yes, it was very good.</p>
<p><em>Um, did you, um, what did you do um, in terms of er, did you go to the local primary school obviously, or…?</em></p>
<p>I went to the XXXX Khan School, and er, because my father was quite rich, I remember, when I was seven, eight, nine years old, at ten o clock we used to have the guy who used to work with us at home, um, and we used to call them servants then, which is quite sad [laughs], I wouldn’t do it now. Um, they used to bring tea and er, biscuits and some sandwiches for us, sandwiches or Indian sort of er, things to eat at lunch time. And they used to bring it to the school for us, so we used to sit and eat. And I used to share that with my friends as well, because some of my friends couldn’t er, they, they wouldn’t have anything for ten o clock, but we used to be lucky enough, we used to have this guy come and give us some food. Um, in the school, I was very naughty. I don’t think I am very clever, I was very clever at all [laughs].</p>
<p><em>Surely not! [laughs].</em></p>
<p>I remember many times the teachers used to make me um, they used to make us stand on the chairs if you were naughty, if we didn’t do our homework. And er, but I, education was not my…er, subjects xxxx. I was very good at sports. I used to play hockey, by the time I was thirteen, fourteen, I was school captain of hockey, I was school captain of netball. And, I used to play um, basketball…um, later on, a lot of sports as well, later I was um, er, we had schools competition under the age of sixteen, which was held in Kampala. And, I was xxxx, first, I came first in the school competition in Uganda under sixteens.</p>
<p><em>And what event was that in?</em></p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p><em>What event was that in?</em></p>
<p>It was long jump.</p>
<p><em>Long jump?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it was long jump.</p>
<p><em>It seems to me, I mean, through some of the interviews I’ve done already…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>It seems that it was quite, in terms of recreational activity, sport was very big amongst the Asian community…</em></p>
<p>It was, it was very big. My, my younger brother, my elder brother used to play um, cricket for the Uganda team during his days. And I think he’s born in nineteen twenty nine (1929) or something like that, during his days he was the captain of the, one of the teams as well. And he was well known for fours and six.</p>
<p><em>What, he was a big hitter?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, he was a big hitter, he, and er, and later, my other brother used to play a lot of golf, anyone xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p><em>And these are very British sports aren’t they?</em></p>
<p>These are very British.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>And it was British protected wasn’t it.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And um…</em></p>
<p>The influence was there, because, Asian cultures were there, they played very important part, but the Western influence was there. To a certain extent.</p>
<p><em>Of course. And, let’s go, you mentioned, let’s go back to the actual Asian community, you mentioned it was er, although a very different and mixed community, different obviously regions, different um, ethnic groups, and also different religions as well…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And cultural groups. Um but despite that, it seems to me, a lot of people have painted the picture, and you have yourself, you suggested that it was still quite a tight knit community regardless of the differences. Um, did you celebrate eachothers cultural events, religious…</em></p>
<p>We celebrated er, in our family, um, I remember when we used to have, I come from a Muslim family, and er, when we used to have Eid, my mother used to prepare lovely plates, quite big er, stain, stainless steel plates, and used to put all different kinds of um, food in there. And mainly it was, sweet rices, they used to cook and things like that. And er, of course the Indian sweets, those, and we used to take it to our neighbours who were Hindus, and our friends who were Hindus and Guajarati’s, and we were, this was done because our parents wanted us to do it. And vice versa at Diwali time we used to exchange the same kinds of foods from the Hindu families. We used to play Gurpa with them, we used to, that is why even now, um, we, we mix quite a lot with the, the Guajarati’s, and er, the Sikhs and Hindus and the different communities, because of that upbringing. And respect them, and it, I respect their cultures. And in fact, it’s because of living in this communities I speak, Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Guajarati, er, very xxxx Guajarati, I speak Kachee (sp?) that’s a dialect as well. And I think my Swahili’s fading, well I think I speak good English. And also, I do a little bit of sign language interpreting in this country.</p>
<p><em>How wonderful!</em></p>
<p>Communicate with deaf people.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. And I’ve seen your capacities working with people with disabilities…</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>And did um, you mentioned Swahili there, and I think this leads on to an interesting topic, and you talked about the um, the relationships between different groups within the Asian community as a whole, can I ask you, you did mention servants, and perhaps at school. What kind of um, in what capacity did you actually spend any time with the African community, perhaps at home or in school, where, when…</em></p>
<p>When my, yeah…</p>
<p><em>Did the two communities mix?</em></p>
<p>When my brothers and sisters were growing up, my edlest sister, who is about fourteen, fifteen years older than me, she was studying only Guajarati, because there was only Guajarati in schools. And later on, my elder sisters, Guajarati and a bit of English, and then later on, my other family, er, sisters and brothers, they learned English and Urdu in schools, because Urdu started coming in. And when I was growing up, it was Africanisation, so er, sixty two (1962), was independence, so we um…yeah, it was quite um, we, we started er, the Africans started joining the schools as well, but there were not that many. Not that many in the schools at that time. They had, another school which was called Wala Hill School in Masaka. And er, my father is the founder member of that school. I’ve got a photograph of that as well. Er xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Oh wow!</em></p>
<p>And he used to work very hard for the school, for the African school, because he felt er, being a Muslim that er, they needed to be educated. And I, and also that to be educated in er, religious studies which was er, learning the Koran as well. And for Koran, they needed to understand other things. So, they basically started that school. And my mother, as a child I remember, she used to go in to the Tambas, Tambas were the African little towns and little farms, she used to go in there trying to bring children out to go to the schools. So they worked quite hard towards that.</p>
<p><em>So that’s interesting, because um…</em></p>
<p>Definitely segregation.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, well that’s the thing, I mean, it seems to be from people I’ve spoken to that the very few, let’s face it [laughs], but also, I mean Yasmin Brown for example, she…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, she would say that.</p>
<p><em>She would argue that there was a lack of integration, it was pure segregation…</em></p>
<p>Of course there was!</p>
<p><em>And other people have painted a picture of perhaps an over romanticised exaggeration where, actually the two communities get on. Did you ever sense any tension at all, perhaps pre-, pre-independence or post independence, between the Asians…</em></p>
<p>There was all, because I now look back and I think, er, the African com, community we, er, there was a kind of a fear, um for the girls to go out on their own, you know, or, going out late at night. There was something that the parents told us to keep away from the African community. And that could be cultural, or whatever, er lack of education whatever you may call it. But there definitely was segregation, yes. But when I was growing up we had er, one young black guy coming to school with us. And I think I was the first one to make a move to talk to him. And maybe I was, that is why [laughs], I married outside the community as well!</p>
<p><em>So you were always a bit of a pioneer! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Um, so you, you probably sensed that there was, er, I mean would you agree that everyone kind of knew their position in society?</em></p>
<p>Yes. I agree that. Everybody, everybody knew where they come from, who they are, and er, of course we were second generation born there, my mother was born there as well, and my grandmother went there at a very young age. So all we knew was Uganda as our home. And er, our place was within the community, that we respect everybody and we were um, respect all the olders, who no matter what background they are from. My uncle, er, his name was Issac. He was not educated, he educated himself in English, and he, um, because his father died at a very young age, I think he was eleven or so, and his mother brought them up, but er, he educated himself and he was very good friend of a couple of ministers. And because my uncle used to live er…we had a house which had about eight rooms on the top and eight at the bottom, and my uncle was not that well to do, and so he used to live downstairs. I don’t like saying this but, it is a family and we were always there, we never knew. We never knew that er, my uncle was not well off, or anything, we just knew as a part of us. That’s all we knew. And he used to have his, couple of ministers used to come, and he used to write speeches for them. Yeah. And I remember one of them used to be Benedict XXXX, I think he was the judge, now I’m talking about my young age, which is what fifty years ago [laughs], I’m talking about when I was twelve, thirteen, fourteen, what I remember. And he was a very good friend of his.</p>
<p><em>Interesting. </em></p>
<p>And he was, he was a magistrate as well, and I think later on, he was killed by er, I don’t know the fact but, something happened to him.</p>
<p><em>Hm mm. </em></p>
<p>Um, because my uncle was very, very upset and he said, look what’s happened. To him.</p>
<p><em>Hm mm. Yeah. And I mean, so it seems, so there was some interaction between the African community and the Asian community but…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx…</p>
<p><em>Only at certain…</em></p>
<p>At, males, with the males only. Men only.</p>
<p><em>Right. </em></p>
<p>Yeah. It was very male dominated.</p>
<p><em>And you said there was a fear for the, the, sort of the female members of the Asian community, do you think that was, erm, obviously we said it could be cultural or it could be religious, do you think it was er, also the fact that they, you were two very different communities culturally, because it seems to me the Asian community was almost quite conservative perhaps compared to the European xxxx, the um, Africans. Would you say you were more, sort of, conservative in the way you acted and stuff?</em></p>
<p>Definitely. Definitely, we were more conservative [beeping sound]. Switch this off, it’s my husband. Soti? Do you think I can finish here…er, this is Greig.</p>
<p><em>Hello, pleased to meet you, how you doing?</em></p>
<p>Greig was, that’s my husband.</p>
<p>[Husband: pleased to meet you, hello].</p>
<p>Er, Greig works er, with the…</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I work for Eastside Community Heritage…</em></p>
<p>[Husband: xxxx]</p>
<p><em>Yeah, we’re doing a project with Prafel Patel and the Indian Overseas Trust at the moment. </em></p>
<p>[Husband: ok].</p>
<p><em>Hence the fact I’m taking your wife away from you for an hour or so [laughs], if that’s ok!</em></p>
<p>[Husband: xxxx]</p>
<p>Can I sit here or can I go - you want to sit here?</p>
<p>[Husband: xxxx carry on]</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>[Husband: yeah, yeah].</p>
<p><em>I appreciate that…</em></p>
<p>Because they are er, interviewing.</p>
<p>[Husband: well, carry on!]</p>
<p><em>Thank you very much!</em></p>
<p>Saying that, my husband, we used to be the er, the rally driver of the er, he used to drive, a rally driver in Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Oh really? That’s quite a big sport wasn’t it, rally driving?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it was a big sport as well.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah. </em></p>
<p>I was going to come to that and then, he also played er, rugby. Again, that’s very British.</p>
<p><em>Yes, of course, yes. And er, Idi Amin was quite a rugby player apparently. </em></p>
<p>Yes, he was. Xxxx as well yeah.</p>
<p><em>He certainly enjoyed it. But I think he thought he was good at everything [laughs]. Xxxx. </em></p>
<p>And he was arrested xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Really? That’s something we can definitely talk about xxxx…</em></p>
<p>We’ll talk about that, yeah. We’ll talk about that.</p>
<p><em>Lots of people have many anecdotes about Amin it seems…</em></p>
<p>Hmmm?</p>
<p><em>Many people have anecdotes of personal dealings with Mr Amin, especially those in Jinja it seems. Um, so we’ve talked about the relationships between the Asian community and the African community, and also between Europeans as well. Um, can I ask whether after um, it seems to me a lot of people almost believe that Idi Amin created this tension, but a lot of people actually suggested there was a tension before, actually after er, independence. Did you notice a change in attitudes of the African community towards the Asians after independence? Did you see a change or…</em></p>
<p>Er…I think I was too young, but, what I heard [phone rings] from family members…[phone ringing then stops]. What I heard family members talking, um, is that when Abota came in, and when there was war in India against Pakistan, at that time er, a lot of er, Hindu and Guajarati families, they collected all their gold and they sent it to…this is what I remember from families talking. Um, send it to India. And after that Abota actually said “you are Ugandans, you shouldn’t be sending things out”. And, the changes started from there, yes.</p>
<p><em>And Idi Amin perhaps just added to it?</em></p>
<p>No, I don’t know whether that’s true or not. This is what I remember people told me.</p>
<p><em>Well again, it goes back to we’re here to measure your memories, not necessarily the accuracy of them. And um, in terms of, um, Amin’s actual declaration, let’s fast forward a little bit from Aboti to Amin when he came in to power. Um, where, can you remember where you were when he made that declaration…?</em></p>
<p>I was in Kampala, yes. I was in Kampala. Um, I went to work, I was working with er, a Dutch company called Thom, and er, I went to work, got up in the morning and went to work, and the roads were dead, the streets were dead. And I [phone rings]…can I just get it xxxx…</p>
<p><em>Please do, not a problem!</em></p>
<p>[continues ringing] Sofi? Sofi can you xxxx xxxx xxxx [talks on phone] Ok, phone is upstairs. Sorry, that was my son [laughs].</p>
<p><em>Not a problem, honestly, like I said, I interrupted your afternoon, I don’t mind [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>No, that’s fine.</p>
<p><em>So we , we were, where were we at? We were um, yeah, the day of the declaration.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, and er, after that, don’t think I went to work for a long time. But er, in the morning the, er, Kampala streets were dead. The marks of those trucks, tractors, they, they were on the wrong side of the road, in the morning when we saw it. But er, we only stayed in old Kampala, there was er, Kabaka’s house at the back. And we, sometimes used to hear shot, you know, and the gun shots. But that’s all I remember now. I think, I think it was quite traumatic, because when he came in, and after that um, the life for a little while, er, little while got very restricted. We were not allowed to go out you know, being the girls of the family, the parents were very restrictive. But somehow there is a black out.</p>
<p><em>Yes, yes. </em></p>
<p>I think sometimes you just, don’t want to remember certain things, and that’s what I’ve done to my mind I think, I don’t remember much about xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Hmm, you kind of tucked it perhaps in one corner…</em></p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p><em>Of your mind. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Not to hopefully, be addressed…</em></p>
<p>But then er, there were more robberies. My, twice er, the Condors they used to call them, they came to our house, once they sort of took er, xxxx shot guns to my mum and took the money the xxxx day. The other time they took my sisters car, they just attacked er, not harm them, but xxxx took whatever they wanted to. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Certainly emotionally harmed them, I would have thought. </em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Um, so, I mean there was a sense of change then, perhaps when Amin to came to power, and then obviously once he made the declaration, it was an obvious change?</em></p>
<p>Yes, there, were, for the first er, um…for the first month, our family never took any notice. My parents didn’t want to, and my brothers who were in the family business, two of my brothers were in the family business, my elder brother used to say to my dad “let’s get xxxx to UK” because we used to have agencies of Masaka Xxxx motors, and er, I think one of the directors, I remember, very clearly my mother, he came, they were not too xxx at that time, so when he came to our house in Masaka, one of the directors, said to my father “look, invest five thousand pounds, they’re going to build er, new, um, airport, Heathrow Airport. And er, you can buy a whole street of houses”, and my father said “No, we are living in Africa and we don’t want to go from Africa.” And even my brothers sort of said a lot of times to get xxxx, and he never did, and xxxx xxxx because he left penniless. Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Obviously had everything confiscated…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, there were a lot of other people who took money out before er, had taken it out. He believed, my mother er, my mother’s family had lived there, my, for years, and you know we were the second, third, third, my brothers really were the third generation there, nobody was going to take us out. I was an automatic Ugandan citizen. I could only come here because I got married to my husband.</p>
<p><em>Who had a British passport?</em></p>
<p>He had a British passport…</p>
<p><em>Xxxx.</em></p>
<p>We got married on the twentieth of September seventy two (1972).</p>
<p><em>Seventy two?</em></p>
<p>So we came here on the eighth of October.</p>
<p><em>Wow, what a turn around. Almost part of xxxx xxxx [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Well no, I don’t think we would have got married if er, he hadn’t checked us out.</p>
<p><em>Of course, of course. And erm, let’s talk about um, I mean you did mention it, and I think we did it off recorder, so look I think we need to record this, um, let’s talk about your actual ancestry. How did your family on either side end up in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>My father went to Uganda…my father came from a little town called Rawali in India, er, and now it is er, Rawal xxxx, it’s quite a big town. And he, I think went there, he’s born in nineteen oh five (1905), sorry, not in nineteen oh six (1906). He was offered, he had er, his mother, his father died when he was six months old, and his father erm, sorry, his mother was married off to somebody else and he knew. All he remembered that there was a lady who used to er, when he used to play outside, she used to call him in, yeah, call him in, and take him behind the door, and then give him a glass of milk, and that’s all he remembers. But he had a very cold childhood, very xxxx childhood. There were two brothers, one sister, and the elder brother was seven years older than him, and he used to do a little bit of work and, bring money in slowly. Grand, blind grandmother would feed them. Then his uncle, who was in Africa, in Uganda, he was already in Uganda during that time. And he was well settled because he used to run um, what do you call, a garage? Er, for clearing, cleaning the guns for the army, British Army.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>And he was a photographer for the British Army there in Uganda, who were there. And he was a very good photographer, we have seen some of his photos, it’s amazing.</p>
<p><em>Wow. </em></p>
<p>And, he er, went to Pakistan because his wife died. And then he got married to his wife’s sister, and he had brought her to Uganda. And they had no children. So when he went to Pakistan, he saw that my father was very intelligent, my father was I think seven, eight years old but he was very, very intelligent. And he wanted to study, so he put him in a school, and in a boarding, in a boarding school and he paid for his education there. But er, at one point my dad said, “oh my uncle paid for the education, but he forgot we needed money to eat food as well!” yeah. My dad’s father, they were seven brothers. And out of those seven brothers, during the early nineties, which is maybe nineteen hundred, nineteen oh two (1900, 1902), nine, oh, before that, must be before that, my father is born in nineteen oh five (1905), then they, it must be before. They left India and they went travelling. And er, one went to Turkey and the other went to Iran, and none of them got back to their homeland, they must have died somewhere along the line. And the only two brothers was my dad’s father, but he died in India then, and then, now it is Pakistan yeah. And er, my er, uncle who then took, when my dad was sixteen he did his er, er, Affid they used to call it, and he asked him to, my father wrote to him, he said “I want to go to UK to do engineering”, at that time which is nineteen twenties, or nineteen nineteen (1920s, 1919), and he then um, said to him “ok, let’s, I’ll take you Uganda and from Uganda I’ll send you to UK for engineering.” But he brought him to Uganda and never sent him.</p>
<p><em>It was stopped along the way [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>It was stopped in Uganda, which my father always felt that his uncle cheated him.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, he found that he could have sent him, and he would have been a very successful education wise, and all that. But he was very successful anyway, and then my, because the uncle started cycle business, and my dad went to it, there was, er, in to it, and there was a time when he had um, er, about twenty, I think he’s mentioned the number of shops he had, he had opened up shops, and he was a very clever business man. Because he used to employ the Africans in our shop. Teach them the business, teach them how to do this, cycles, you know, some of the cycles, and then he used to go and open them a shop.</p>
<p><em>It was like a franchise business?</em></p>
<p>And he, yeah, but they didn’t have any money to pay for it initially. So then, he had people who would come back to him to buy the stock. So he was very successful, a very clever businessman. And he believed in cash business. And he believed that er, that you shouldn’t take any overdrafts or anything like that from the banks, so it was all cash. Until my brothers came in to business and that’s when the overdraft, and the English way of things started happening.</p>
<p><em>Credit?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. My dad was very successful, he, not only that he also used to, because he was an orphan, er, he used to bring couple, I remember three people, my mum used to tell us about, the ninth in the line from the top, so I was quite young, and she used to say that he, they used to bring them from an orphanage in Pakistan, which is now Pakistan, then it was India. And they used to work in our shop, and he used to settle the orphan people, er, children. You know, they were used to, he used to bring them at the age of fourteen or fifteen, and then look after them, and then a couple of them he got them married as well and settled. And there was a family, that my mother’s, and father, was very close to, because they used to go with us, my father in the, in his shop. And they became very good friends and it was like one family. But that started it. And even on mothers side of the family, my father sort of supported them, and the cycle business and settle, because they were very young when their father died. When my mother’s er, father died, er, they owned the then land in Jinja, which is the old xxxx. That’s what they owned here, and they were very rich, my grandmother was very rich, my grandfather was very rich.</p>
<p><em>And how did they get to, on your mother’s side, how did they get to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>They got to Uganda, my mother’s side got to Uganda, my grandfather came er, here, but I know about um, my grandfather, my mother’s father came um, in eighteen six or eighty two (1882?), something like that, we don’t have the exact dates, but we worked our dates backwards, and my grandmother, is the one who came from Persia. And my grandfather came from India, I don’t know what part of India, but now it is in er, Pakistan, I think it’s Pindi, Pindisidra, Pindi side, he came from there. And they settled. But he was a very well known man at that time.</p>
<p><em>Hm mm. And also he sounds like a very generous man.</em></p>
<p>He died very young, he…his wife, er, his wife was in Purda, you know, my grandmother was in Purda, at that time, and people cheated her and had the documents signed and that’s how she lost all her property. And she was quite young as well, she was young, she had er, I’ve got four aunties, my mother, including my mother, they’re four sisters. Er, four brothers. And the youngest one died, so all others were younger than my father. My mother was sec-, third youngest. So she was one of the older children. Who at, then, my father sort of took her family as his own as well, because he had no other family.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>It sounds like him being brought up as an orphan really affected his life in the ways he treated others…</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>What a wonderful thing.</em></p>
<p>Yes, he was er, he was a man of principle and also he was very um, he wanted all of us to educate ourselves. And he did.</p>
<p><em>It’s like any parent, they want a better life for their children. </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Especially if they’ve lived such an aw-, well testing um, impoverished life. </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>[Husband: Rally aswell?]</p>

<p><em>Mainly in Kampala and Jinja it seems. But I’ll send them to you. </em></p>
<p>Yeah xxxx, just before you go, just before you go, do you want to ask him what happened when he was arrested?</p>
<p><em>If you don’t mind…</em></p>
<p>Yes, please, recording it, just two minutes, if you get that information.</p>
<p>[Husband: I think it’s just a very long…]</p>
<p>No no, but you can just give the gist of it, no.</p>
<p>[Husband: alright, xxxx].</p>
<p>Then I’ll er, er, elaborate, elaborate it…</p>
<p>[Husband: Well you know exactly what happened]</p>
<p>No I don’t know, because at times I’m…</p>
<p>[Husband: ok. Er, say, where shall we start?]</p>
<p>What happened, how, why were you arrested?</p>
<p>[Husband: well, this is when a body attack, attacked Amin, at the border, at the common border with Tanzania Uganda, and er…]</p>
<p>This was during the time of the expulsion.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>[Husband: And er, [coughs], Amin always thought that the Israelis were behind all this. So we went xxxx which was xxxx fifty miles, from Kampala, just xxxx xxxx. And we were listening to the radio, my friend was sitting on the back seat, xxxx sticking out. Er, military police, jeep you know, xxxx “what are you guys doing here?” Xxxx “listening to the radio”. So they took us to the police station. This friend of mine, he was very fair skinned so they said he was an Israeli, and he said “no, I’m xxxx Indian, Asian, Muslim”. And they looked at me and he says “You’re an Israeli as well because I was quite fair xxxx xxxx. And um, I said “No, I’m a Gala Singh, a Singh”, they won’t believe it. So they er, checked the car out, they stole a xxxx xxxx. They telephoned in the morning, said xxxxhaving a breakfast, because we were waiting for Amin’s xxxx man called Ibrahim. Er, they were waiting xxxx xxxx they were waiting for him and we knew they would sort it out for us. But he didn’t arrive, so they took us in, and er, he had xxxx xxxx police er, Ambali, and then we had to wait for the command to come in…you know this is going to the torture part of the room. All the biggest one, everyone so, they were saying things like “if you ask him to walk for us on his knees, he won’t even ow, he won’t even hurt xxxx”. I said I might be bleeding or you know. So the commander came and a Colonel, we used to rally with him, Suleman, and he was a xxxx when I used to do rallying with him and he looked at us and ignored us. So…]</p>
<p>They made you sit on the floor, in the prison didn’t they?</p>
<p>[Husband: This is Mikindi]</p>
<p>This is Mikindi yeah, so you were in the Mikindi prison, they took you to…</p>
<p>[Husband: this is um, Kampali. Then he send us to Kimpali, he said “I don’t want to deal with them.” That maybe xxxx was head of xxxx police, so we, er, we were driven there and um, was made to sit on the floor, and this was the time British journalists were arrested as well, and they were given a task, and every time xxxx run off with the newspapers, and there’s no dropping off on the floor. And er, they were threatening us like that, young kids, especially when picking on the old timer.]</p>
<p><em>Did you believe it, were you scared for your life?</em></p>
<p>[Husband: Yes I did, my best friend, the first time I looked at him, I said “I wonder do you think we will get out of this place alive?” But er, Major XXxx wasn’t there, he’d gone to meet er, the president because, to discuss the conflict. And they had arrested Aboti’s brother. One of xxxx xxxx. We jumped up, and he says “Don’t worry, don’t worry. Don’t xxxx away [laughs]”.]</p>
<p><em>XXXX. </em></p>
<p>[Husband: Major XXXX came two hours later, in er, and he couldn’t speak English, Major XXXX, he said “bring all those Indians in here”. And went in there…and he says “Ok, do you have any belongings here?” I said “Yes, my trousers are in here”. He says, “Over there. Anything else?”. I said “There’s my car.” So the sergeant says “We hand over the car keys at the gate” he said “we don’t bring the keys here”. “Keys, these are your keys, here’s your keys, bugger off”.]</p>
<p><em>So you escaped with your life but you lost your car?</em></p>
<p>[husband: No, no, they gave my car.]</p>
<p><em>They gave your car back?</em></p>
<p>[Husband: yeah, yeah.]</p>
<p><em>Wow, what a horrendous um, situation to be in!</em></p>
<p>[Husband: yeah. And there was another friend of ours who was in jail at that time, and er, we saw him, walking alongside him, er he was arrested just because he was wearing army fatigues. And his main job was to, they had a room where the Africans, you know the guys who were arrested, xxxx xxxx they were out, they were told break away skull. And, and full of xxxx to clean the mattresses.]</p>
<p><em>No way. </em></p>
<p>[Husband: I think, it must be in London somewhere].</p>
<p><em>Thank you ever so much for that, I realise it’s not the easiest thing to talk about…</em></p>
<p>[Husband: No, no, no, [laughs], doesn’t bother me].</p>
<p><em>Xxxx some people it could you know, I really do appreciate it.</em></p>
<p>[Husband: I’ll send you a bill for that!]</p>
<p><em>[laughs] I hope you are cheap! See you soon. That, well that kind of gives us a very real taste of a lot of stories I’ve heard, you know. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, because his was quite quick in going then, so xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Yeah of course, no, no. </em></p>
<p>The problem about Jinja being, er my mum, my um, mum’s family, her father and her mum was called Zinna Bebe, her father was called, er, God, I can’t really remember xxxx. Um, mum, and er, her brother who was alive was very well known in Jinja. He was known by Yousef Cycles, and they used to have cycle shops on the main road.</p>
<p><em>I’ve got, I interviewed a man last, two days ago, called Ajit Singh.</em></p>
<p>Perxxxx?</p>
<p><em>Could have been…</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Do you know him?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I know him very well.</p>
<p><em>He’s a very fit, he used to enjoy cycling in Jinja he said. </em></p>
<p>And he was er, speaking on the radio xxxx. Yeah I know him.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx small world. </em></p>
<p>Call him uncle.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>I call him uncle, yeah [laughs]. He knows me very well. Yes.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t mention you because obviously I’m interviewing you…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, they are, they’re all from Jinja, you see. They are from Jinja, so er, XXXX is from Jinja and he’s giving lots of er…</p>
<p><em>Yeah, he’s xxxx xxxx</em></p>
<p>All the Jinja people, yeah. But then they were people, but my uncle is quite well known, and one thing, the beauty, are you recording that because that will be quite interesting, because the beauty about my uncle was, he, he was very rich. He married a Polish lady, during the second world war, there were camps in Uganda, right? Um, the ships went from Germany or Poland, where ever, they went to America. America did not let them dock there, right, and then they were sent to Uganda, and they wanted to make Israel in the north part or the south part of Uganda, something like that. Yeah, and er, it didn’t happen, so they, they had camps there. And my uncle, at that very tender age, my uncle was very, very handsome. And my auntie, we call her mummy G, because she was married, er, she later married my uncle, um, had a limp as well, a very obvious limp. And in those days, people would not look at disability very favourable in those days, but my uncle married her, and their marriage was very successful, they had, she brought a daughter with her, and this was when my uncle used to go to camps, you know, to give them some food, or to bring them out to their own houses to come and um, sort of see the outside, the outside of the camps, because they were very deprived people at that time, second world war people. And he used to bring her home, and that is how they happened to get married. What my mum said, that my auntie never knew a word of er, Swahili, or little English, no English, or any other language. And my uncle didn’t know…</p>
<p><em>Speak Polish or german?</em></p>
<p>Polish or anything. How they communicated, God knows. But, they got married, had four daughters, one daughter was, the edl-, the daughter which my auntie brought with her, was adopted by my uncle. So he had five daughters.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. </em></p>
<p>And he, he, he had a lot of money as well, he was very, very rich. It was, mill-, millionaires in shillings, with like my father, then it was millions xxxx pounds. And er, he, I went er, one, once during the school holidays to Jinja, and we were walking with my mother. And er, a lady, Guajarati lady stopped my mother, and she said er, “you are Yusef’s sister, I remember you as a little girl.” And she said “yes”. And she said, “You know, we are very poor, your, your brother sends us ration every month. And he doesn’t tell anybody he has sent us ration, every month. And he does that quite, to quite a lot of people.” And that is because they had seen so much poverty in their lives.</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>They make their money, but they had seen poverty in their lives as well.</p>
<p><em>In the same way that your dad was brought as an orphan, and then became a generous man because of that…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx, he has an effect, and I think the way er, that children are brought up also is a lot of er, they take on what their parents have given them, really. That’s what it is.</p>
<p><em>It’s, er, yeah, I mean you find if you are brought up in relative impoverishment, you certainly don’t want your own children to go through that experience xxxx.</em></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><em>You do anything to provide a life for them that perhaps you didn’t get yourself. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. We all had wonderful life, my, one of my sister was sent to Pakistan, she wanted to go to Pakistan to study, she studied there for four, five years. My brother was sent there, my other bro-, sister was, my other brother was sent to UK, I was sent to UK to study. All of us studied. Only the elder one didn’t because there was no education at that time. So there was that difference. But we had a very good um, good life.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. People do seem to, er people, um, who I’ve spoken to really did seem to enjoy the simplicity of living in Uganda, it seems. </em></p>
<p>It’s lovely country, the weather was lovely, the, there was no airs, nobody said I’m a millionaire, nobody said you are poor. You know, it, it was just one of those things, accepted things, you have it, you have it, you don’t have it, you don’t have it. This was in Masaka, I can’t talk about because it is, yes. And we had a neighbour who was Guajarati and I remember when my dad used to come from er, Kampala on the way, they had these market stall, er, the African women or men xxxx selling um, bananas, and things like that. And he used to bring basket fulls of, full of that and my mother used to give us some and said “take it to the neighbours next door.” Because she was a widow, and she had two little girls. And it was just, done. Nobody questioned why, the children never asked why do you want to send it, we were told to take it, we used to take it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. And nobody expected thanks or praise for it…</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>It was something xxxx…</em></p>
<p>Nobody did, no, no nobody did that at all, it was, it was amazing. We, here in the UK, when I moved in to this house in seventy five (1975), my neighbours across the road, um, on the side of the road, there were a couple of er, neighbours from Africa, from Jinja. This lady from Jinja there, no not Jinja, xxxx there, and Nairobi from er, Kenya. And we are like a family. We dropping in to eachothers house, we take care of each other, and it’s like just being at home. And when I tell people that our street is like that, the few houses on this street, they are amazed. You remember next door, English neighbour…Phillip, he’s in late eighties, wife is ninety one. I asked them years ago, don’t you want to move, too many Asians are moving here. And he said, she said to me, she said “No, I know I’ve got nice neighbours, I don’t need to move.” She’s still here.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. She’d probably move if white people started moving here! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Probably will, yeah! Yeah, so we have a very good neighbourhood here. You know…</p>
<p><em>It seems that way…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx carry on the culture, we have carried on.</p>
<p><em>Definitely, and I xxxx you know, I’m doing a lot more interviews in Hounslow than I am in [laughs] xxxx, ‘cause there is quite a lot of Ugandan Asians have ended up here.</em></p>
<p>In, in Hounslow, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Completely, we’ll talk about that perhaps in a moment. Um, let’s go back, we were talking about sort of the um, the period of after the declaration. And you said you’d sort of perhaps tried to wipe out some of the memories, ‘cause perhaps they were a bit too xxxx…</em></p>
<p>After the independence, after er, when Idi Amin took over.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, when he took over…</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Um, how um, I’ve asked you about sort of where you were when the declaration was made, and also you said your parents perhaps didn’t react to it initially, um, I’ve been told by a lot of people they didn’t quite take Idi Amin that seriously actually, um…</em></p>
<p>No they did.</p>
<p><em>He used to say things like this all the while for xxxx.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, they didn’t, they er, well, when he said that I’m giving you, I dreamt that I want to give you three months to leave…nobody bothered. We didn’t bother, my parents didn’t bother, my brothers didn’t think about it at all. Until, serious things started happening, people get started getting hurt, African people started getting killed, you know. Um, some er, the mayor of Masaka was murdered in a horrible way. It er, er, it was quite a sad occasion when he was murdered, and it was horrifying because I remember I came er, I was in the back of, our shop was in front of our house, it was house and shop in the house behind, I came outside, and my brother, younger brother just said to me “go inside, you don’t want to see and you don’t want to know anything.” And that was it. So we did live a protected life, they didn’t want to tell us unless, unless we read it in the papers.</p>
<p><em>Hm mm. But you know, you still sense danger, even if you’re behind a wall. </em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>You can still, you know, a hostile environment, you can feel that. </em></p>
<p>Hmm mmm.</p>
<p><em>So er, let me ask, let’s talk about your actual um, the period where you left Uganda then. Er, at what point did you realise you had to leave? It was, obviously you’d been told ninety days but, you, you’d said it was a sense that you were getting more and more tension, more fear…</em></p>
<p>Late September.</p>
<p><em>What was the point when you realised?</em></p>
<p>I think middle of September, the first week in September, my father decided that he should send all the girls out of the country. And children. And I was over age, I was not eighteen, er, I was twenty four, and so therefore I was Uganda Asian. Full stop. There was no, second question. And, the Britain won’t take me, because I was not married. No other country would take me, they would only take the refugees. I was not a refugee. And er, I knew my husband, and er, he said “let’s get married, I’ll take you to London.” And we got married on, we were supposed to get married on the fifteen, then, fifteenth of September and he was arrested. The story he told you just now. And he didn’t turn up at the Registry wedding, and I came, and, and, I was working with this, Dutch company, and my manager said “What happened?” I said “He hasn’t turned up!” [laughs].</p>
<p>[Audio A ends(49:58), Audio B begins]</p>
<p><em>We’re back, so can we, until the interruption, um, you were talking quite specifically about erm, the period of where your family were trying to get you and your sisters out, and the children out of the country…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, my…</p>
<p><em>And you, you were getting married and your husband didn’t turn up…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, he didn’t turn up on the fifteenth of September, because he was arrested and he was in the Mtinde prison. Um, and then, er, he rearranged the date for the twentieth, and he came late! [laughs]. And he, I was walking home, because nobody else knew we were getting married. And my mum knew, I told my mum that he was er, marrying me to get me out of the country. And, we came here and we stayed together, and that was it. And er, because, um, but er, my dad took my sisters children, my brother in law, my sister in law and her children to Pakistan. They went to Pakistan and er, my dad later on granted er, a house until they, until their husbands came and then they moved all over the world. But er, one of my brother and his son was airlifted, one was airlifted to Malta camp. My eldest brother was airlifted to Malta camp, my brother in law ended up in Rome, he was a doctor so then later on he joined xxxx Detroit in America. One of my sisters ended up in America. My other brother, his wife was in Pakistan, eventually with the children they ended up in er, um, Toronto. One of my brother, who died in, on September the twenty sixth, last year, always had a very sad life. And er, he was my, from my xxxx, third brother, he had two little girls and er, his wife left him. So the girls, he, the wife left him I think in seventy or seventy two (1970, 1972) something like that. And the girls, two little girls, one was five and seven or eight, something, tender ages, they were living with us. And my dad took them to Pakistan and then er, he went to Pakistan, and he wanted to start a business there. But, my father didn’t have any money to give it to him to start any business. So he and my uncle’s son, they left Pakistan, with the two little girls, went to Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, ended up in Austria. And they travelled on the back of the lorries, um, buses and trains, in people’s cars, with two little girls. At times they could find food for them, at times they couldn’t, they had very terrible lives. So they ended up in Austria camp, in a refugee camp. And finally, Sweden took them. It was very sad because he used to come to England every year, and, to see my mum and dad who were now in Manchester, and his daughter who was then thirteen had an accident and, er, in Holland while they were travelling to London, and she broke her clavicle. And she was in hospital for eight, nine months. He used to work at night, and the red cross in Sweden was brilliant. They used to send a nurse to look after the children over night. And so, therefore he had a little bit of settled life. But his childhood, my father sent him to study in Pakistan, was quite sad because my dad used to send money to the people of the relatives to pay for his school fees, they never did. And he was starved, and he was beaten up by the people. My dad never knew until somebody told him and then he went and brought him back xxxx. That was five, xxxx twenty years he must have had, because during those days, there was no telephones, nothing like that. So, he had a sad life, he died last September. Um, the rest of the family, eventually got together. My younger brothers also to came to London, ‘cause they, my mother had a British passport. My other brother was already studying here. And er, I xxxx, I came with my husband on the eighth of October. I settled here in Hounslow, and er, others, two of my sisters settled in Manchester. Two of my brothers settled in Manchester, so we were all over the world. My mum, it is very, very sad, because what happened to my mum was um, I, I went to see my mum in Manchester in seventy three (1973), and er, there was something not right about her, so I said to her, where I used to go, I used to sleep on the same bed as my mum. You know, although I was married, I had a little girl [laughs]. My daughter used to be in a cot there, and I used to just sleep with my mother! And er, I asked her, I saw some difference in her and I, I said, what’s the matter, what’s bothering you? She said, “When I climbed the stairs of the aeroplane,” she said, “when I was walking towards the airplane and to, to the airport, I started forgetting my home.” And she said, “I can’t remember somethings.” In seventy…five (1975), they diagnosed, she had Alzheimers. And she died. She had never been separated from my father until the exodus, because my father took the children to Pakistan, my mother had a British passport, she came here in a camp, in Manchester. And three years later my father was sponsored by, my, my elder brother to come and join them in the UK, so, three years she was away from my father.</p>
<p><em>And that had an obvious effect on her?</em></p>
<p>It had a lot of effect. She never saw her children again. Together, before she died in seventy nine (1979). She was only sixty six. Mind you, she had all eleven of us by the time she was forty [laughs]. That’s the positive side.</p>
<p><em>Yeah of course, and you know, if…</em></p>
<p>But it was a trauma for the family because er, trauma for the family, we lost all the money, we lost, er, my father had er, four houses in Masaka, and couple in Jin-, in Kampala. And he had er, also lots of er, er, he had shops in Barara and in Masaka and Kampala, and we had a lot of cash money at home. My brothers, when they left Uganda, they left the keys of the shop with er, the, the manager, the African manager who used to work with us. Thir-, twenty five years later, from my brother xxxx Sweden, went back to Uganda and he looked for that xxxx, his name is Yousefu. He looked for him and er, he found him, and the man said to him, my brother, Xxxx my brother said, my brother said he was very old, and he said “I have got mama’s bed, and mama’s cupboard.” They used to call my mummy, mama. And my brother was touched and he said, “I have saved it in my house for your mother, because she loves these things.” And the children, er, the, the, the manager er, grew up in the family from the age of twelve. Yeah, they worked with us in our shops from the age of twelve, and they gotten older as well, because they are the same ages as my brothers. Elder brothers. And my dad had imported that bed from England, in nineteen thirty (1930). I think that bed would cost about twenty thousand pounds now. It had er, the chrome erm, gold plated er, things on the sides, four posters…</p>
<p><em>Posters?</em></p>
<p>Four posters. And the er, the cupboard was Chinese, it had Chinese painting, hand paintings on it.</p>
<p><em>And it was still there?</em></p>
<p>So, yes, so he said to my, he said to my brother, said to Yousef, “Well, Mama is dead now. You keep it, we don’t need it.” But, twenty five years, he still saved it for my mum. Yeah, they used to call my mum, mum. Because they xxxx xxxx things like that, they worked in the shop and they used to come and have food.</p>
<p><em>What a wonderful story xxxx.</em></p>
<p>Xxxx. I mean there’s so many different things that come to your mind, it’s not that all families treated Africans badly. No they didn’t. That’s not true. Because they were families, there were families who looked after them. When my mum got married at the age of thirteen, or fourteen, she went to Masaka at the age of sixteen. And they had this house boy who used to work for them, xxxx, who was fourteen, fifteen? So my mum and he grew up together. Yeah, and my mum used to say, that er, when he xxx, he was retiring, er, said to my brothers, “If he comes to the shop, give him free tyres. Give him everything, because he is my friend, and we’ve grown up together.”</p>
<p><em>That’s amazing. </em></p>
<p>That’s amazing.</p>
<p><em>What a wonderful perspective as well. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Because as I said earlier…</em></p>
<p>His name was Samili, I remember it.</p>
<p><em>As I said earlier, it seems to me that people sort of, they do talk about this um, the potential tension and jealousy between the two, certain communities there. But stories like that show that there were a certain unity and xxxx different xxxx certain xxxx…</em></p>
<p>There was, because you know, even now, if somebody’s staying with you, yeah, if somebody stays with you that do become a part of your family. They might be different culture, different faith, but they do become part of your family and…</p>
<p><em>Especially when your family is as generous as your family obviously as well [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>My father was very generous, my mother was very generous.</p>
<p><em>It certainly seems so. And erm, so er, after the expulsion obviously, you’ve quite, um, quite beautifully and emotionally described some of the processes you went through, you, I mean from a financial point of view it seems that everything your father and mother had worked to provide for you…</em></p>
<p>Lost it.</p>
<p><em>Just gone, literally. </em></p>
<p>Just gone.</p>
<p><em>You’ve talked about the emotional trauma that your mum experienced from being split from her family, never seeing the eleven children together as well, which obviously had an effect on her. Um…</em></p>
<p>And on us! And on us.</p>
<p><em>And on yourself as well. </em></p>
<p>And because of that, I worked with er, um, Alzheimer’s society. I did a lot of work with Alzheimer’s, people who suffered with Alzheimer’s. And er, I…produced leaflets with the help of the Alzheimer’s Society, for Asian people. What we did was, at my work, we wrote it in our languages, in four languages then translated it in English, and then back in to those languages, simply Alzheimer’s leaflets saying, lock your doors, or how to treat, and I was funded by Alzheimer’s national to do that, and they funded the journalist as well, because I believed they thought I wasn’t good enough at English [laughs]!</p>
<p><em>I hope you proved them wrong!</em></p>
<p>No, no, no, they were very good, they were very good. And er, this was I think in the eighties (1980s), or late eighties (1980s) something like that. And er, they, the leaflets were I understand, then translated in to ninety languages. But I checked up now, and they can’t find the leaflet. I’ve got a copy of it.</p>
<p><em>Keep it. </em></p>
<p>Copy of the leaflet. I can’t find an English translation, but I’ve got the Indian ones. Translated one.</p>
<p><em>XXXX. </em></p>
<p>And they acknowledged me nationally on the back of the leaflets as well.</p>
<p><em>That’s wonderful. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, so it was quite, I xxxx…</p>
<p><em>XXXX it’s really wonderful that you know, you’ve seen an issue with your mum, and er…</em></p>
<p>And I took it forward.</p>
<p><em>You took it forward,in to, to help others as well, perhaps when your mum couldn’t get the help xxxx.</em></p>
<p>No this was after she died.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>You see it’s always a shock when all of a sudden, you’ve lost your country, you lost your brothers and sisters, your siblings have moved away, corners where they are, and then your mother gets this illness. And your younger brothers have got not enough money to live, you know, it is been very difficult. Very, very difficult.</p>
<p><em>Definitely. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And um, so your life in Britain, I know, I’m understanding you’d already been to Britain to study before xxxx…</em></p>
<p>I was studying here in nineteen sixty eight (1968), and so was my xxxx, husband here in, from nineteen sixty five (1965) he was studying here.</p>
<p><em>So I often, I often ask about your first impressions of England, so let’s go back to sixty eight (1968), regardless of the fact you didn’t first come here for the expulsion. What was your first reaction, what were your first impressions?</em></p>
<p>When I first came to UK it was beautiful. There was so much snow! [laughs]. I went to my other sister in Manchester in sixty eight (1968), or sixty seven (1967) December? November, December. And er, there was so much snow, the first thing she took me to a big store, I don’t know which store it was, and she bought me shoes and she said to me, because she was my elder sister I was listening to her, she said, “Do you know, buy the shoes with the fur inside.” And she bought me these lovely boots, they were so cosy. But when I went to the college in er, Hastings, I was work, er, I went, I was studying in Hastings, I went to the college there and the girls laughed [laughs]. They said their mother, er, grandmother shoes [laughs]! But, they kept me warm.</p>
<p><em>They were practical!</em></p>
<p>I didn’t know the fashion!</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>I didn’t know the fashion. My sister meant well, she wanted me to be warm [laughs].</p>
<p><em>I would argue that you’re a fashion um, setter. You’re a trailblazer! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>[laughs].</p>
<p><em>Everyone’s wearing those boots nowadays! [laughs]</em></p>
<p>[laughs]. It was amazing because then, I thought, oh my God, I’m really old fashioned. No I’m not! [laughs]. But that was first imp-, it was very, very cold and my sister and her husband, came, took me in a car, took me to Hastings from Manchester, and went back the same day. Can you believe that? ‘Cause I was staying with a family, and they just went to drop me, so I stay, I studied there. It was er, er, and I’m glad I did that course, if I’d done anything else I probably would have never got jobs. But I’ve never been without a job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>I did er, it was Business Education.</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>It had shorthand, it had typing, believe it or not there was a subject called Business English. And er, there were other things like er, book keeping and all that course and it was a er, a year and half, or two years course there. And when I did that I was never without a job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. And obviously you went back to Uganda, did you ever think you would ever end up back in England when you went back to Uganda? Before the expulsion</em> <em>did you used…</em></p>
<p>I went back to Uganda, um, late sixty nine (1969), I got a job with a travel agency called East African Travels. And because of my so many different language skills, they gave me a job in Regent’s Street in London.</p>
<p><em>What, after the expulsion?</em></p>
<p>No before that.</p>
<p><em>Oh before, before that, yeah. </em></p>
<p>Before that, before the expulsion. So then I came back and worked six months in England, and then I went back and then I got a job. But after the expulsion, during the expulsion I…er, because my nieces and nephews and some family members didn’t have passports, didn’t have documents, I was forever standing in the queues to get their documents. And time to get the family, getting out of the country.</p>
<p><em>And…</em></p>
<p>I didn’t think of myself, being the only one, Uganda passport.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, you, you should have been in the queue for the British passport [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Oh, I’ve got it. I wouldn’t have got it because it was not er, I wasn’t er…</p>
<p><em>You had no right to. </em></p>
<p>I had no rights to it. Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Um, so obviously when you came back after the expulsion, where did you settle?You said you came here in seventy five (1975), was it, Hounslow?</em></p>
<p>We came here in seventy two (1972), October. And I stayed one night with my husband’s er, uncle, um, separate rooms [laughs]! They didn’t know we were married because he’s Sikh and I’m Muslim. And then I went to see, my sister was already living in Manchester, my other sister, so I went to, Manchester. And I came back after a month, when I told my brother in law about my wedding, he was very disappointed. He said he shouldn’t have got married, it would have been better if you were dead because you married outside your religion, you married - er, I came back to London, and we had, we stayed with my husband’s friend. My, Sufi was here, as er, since sixty five (1965) and he had loads of friends here. And he, er, funny enough his friend is called Raj, and er, he got on the Piccadilly line, and he saw this man, and he saw this man talking to another Asian guy. And asking him, do you know where Sufi is going. Because Uganda there, everybody thought everybody knew everyone, but that wasn’t true [laughs]. But my, but er, Sufi got up and he thought that was Raj…and he went, he had a newspaper and he just patted his shoulder and xxxx, so he took him home to his flat in Northfields, he had got married to an Indian girl and they were living in a room. And he stayed with them for one month. Two single beds, four of us in one room. [laughs].</p>
<p><em>Cosy! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Cosy! He helped us, he supported us. We had no idea, because we did not come in er, we did not go to the refugee camps, it was harder for us. We had no money, we didn’t know if we could get benefits, we didn’t try, we had no idea there was anything called benefits. What, er, because mine, er, um, because of my course that I did, my short hand was a hundred and ten. And I started working on the first November, nineteen seventy two (1972) and never stopped.</p>
<p><em>Wow. </em></p>
<p>I joined the Bank of Scotland, that used to be nice work as a shorthand typist, with the branch manager. And from then, I moved up, progressed.</p>
<p><em>Wow. Wonderful. </em></p>
<p>But I’ve never stopped working. And my husband then later on got a job I think in February or March, and then we moved to a one bedroom on Alladine(sp?) Road. Prior to that, Sufi and I were looking for a room, everywhere, every Indian we went to, or a Pakistani we went to for a room, they wouldn’t give us a room. Because, I’m Muslim, he’s Sikh. Yeah. There was one guy, who, who was able to rent, who said he will rent the room to us, and er, but what he, the questions that he asked were so- do you know how to use the toilet. You sit on the toilet this way, you don’t behave this way, and er, in the fridge you can’t put any meat in, you can’t put this in, you can’t use the fridge. And we thought this is our only room we can get, because we couldn’t with er, Raj for more than, you know, the quiet time, his landlord he was bothering him as well. And er, we never xxxx the rent, I think three fifty or something, three pounds fifty, something like that. He gave us the key, and he was so disappointed, there was so many restriction my husband threw the key over the bridge, you know the xxxx bridge? And he said “Damn it, we’re not going there!” [laughs]. So we got a room here in Alladine Road, we stayed there, and then Sufi’s parents were, went to India. And they came er, and they were, they wanted, they were British passport holders, they went to India, every bit they took from Uganda was taken by the customs. In India. They, they confiscated it. Everything. And that was an Indian country, I meant, Indian people are going there as refugees, and they got nothing back. So we, er, because I was allowed to bring hundred and ten pounds, and Sufi was allowed to bring fifty pounds, and then I started working, so we send them tickets to come and join us in England. Him and er, my mother and my father in law, then he rented a house on Alladine Road, and when he rented a house, a three bedroom house, my sister in law also moved in. From one bedroom, with two suitcases, we came to Alladine Road, forty eight Alladine Road, from forty eight Alladine Road er, two years later in nineteen ninety five, we bought this house. And we actually walked with our stuff. But we have six suitcases then, and we had a lot more stuff. The lady Mrs Spindler, who er, had put this house for sale, we used to go to work and we used to pass this house, and it had for sale board on it, so er, we negotiated with her, and she was so good, I think we bought it for twelve or something like that. She was so good, that somebody was going to loan us some money, and he refused, to then give us. We only needed sixteen hundred pounds for the deposit, so we collected hundred from here, two hundred from there, yeah. To do that. And er, my husband came to her and he said we can’t get the deposit together, and she said, “Don’t worry, I am going to emigrate to Austr-, New Zealand”, because her husband had died, her daughter was in New Zealand. “But I will wait until you get the deposit together.” The people opposite, in one seven nine, they offered five hundred pounds more for this house, she said “No, I’ve given my word to young Dhillons”. She waited seven months until we could get the deposit together, and sold it to us.</p>
<p><em>Wow. </em></p>
<p>I mean really, I never forget the lady, because she, Mrs Spindler, um, left extra bulbs in all the rooms, extra bulbs. Every where, she was not supposed to leave any beds or anything, she said I’ll sell them. She left all the beds there. She left the house full of things including pots and pans, she knew we didn’t have much. And she, there are very kind people, and she said to us that we er, “I know how you have suffered, and how hard you are working, and I gave you my word, and I will leave everything for you.” And she did.</p>
<p><em>That’s, what a wonderful story. </em></p>
<p>She was a wonderful lady.</p>
<p><em>I would also suggest that good things happen to good people though, perhaps your families generosity that they’d obviously xxxx…</em></p>
<p>She, was, she was really good to me. But I’ve had very good experiences with people. I have had er, with my working life er, in nineteen seventy two (1972), er, in nineteen seventy three (1973) I started helping people in my own time to fill their forms out, do this bit, or you know. Ugandan people got very depressed when they came here, because families were not around, they had no businesses. The people wouldn’t have money, in Uganda, they very wealthier. For extremely wealth, ‘cause all their families went out to work. And, while the families, like ours, who got separated, emotionally it was very taxing. And there were lots of families like that, like that anyway. And so I was helping them to do the forms. And then I started working for fire stone, I worked for fire stone for three months, and then I had another baby, and I mean we had very little money to live on. Um, my husband, Sufi worked for Hawker Sydney (?), and er, he had bad experience. He, very well spoken, Sufi is very well spoken, um, people used to say that he speak with a plum in your mouth. And I never knew what plum in your mouth means [laughs], until somebody told me, it’s snobbishness [laughs] xxxx. And he was working in Hawker Sydney in the accounts department, and there was this English lady, she said “I don’t want to sit next to him.” She was very racist. And he had bad experience there, but- and they the way they talked to him was, this is a calculator, you people have never seen a calculator in your life. Things like that, they spoke to him. But er, I think he then, left the job because I was, had a baby and he joined London Transport, and from London Transport he moved on until our own businesses. He had a lot of losses in, he had a losses in businesses because people didn’t give him money back, you know, I mean, business. But it’s, we’re ok.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx looking round your wonderful house I think…</em></p>
<p>He’s done it himself, he’s decorated, he’s now a decorator.</p>
<p><em>Oh really? I love the colour of the kitchen, I have to admit [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p><em>I really love the colour of the kitchen, it’s kind of a nice duck egg grey blue. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx. </em></p>
<p>Well we are re-doing it now, as you can see it is half painted in, in xxxx.</p>
<p><em>I’ll tell you what, we’ll move this in to my kitchen, you can…</em></p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p><em>Come to my kitchen and we’ll swap [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Why not, why not!</p>
<p><em>But you um, if I, you um, you touched on something there in terms of um, you know, we’ve talked about the positive um experience you had with say, let’s refer to them as the Anglo or the native population of Britain, the existing population when you arrived. Um, but also if you look back at the time period, um, we mentioned it before we started recording, you have sixty eight (1968) you have Enoch Powell, you have the race relation act which was a direct consequence of the Kenyan expulsion…</em></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>Which you know, is pretty much deemed as one of the most harshest anti-migrant piece of legislation, probably over the past xxxx, by Callahan. Um, and obviously you then had late sixties, early seventies (1960s, 1970s) you had quite an increase in support for groups like the NF and later the BNP. So it was a real time of quite a divided society in Britain. Unfortunately, you throw twenty eight thousand Ugandan Asians in to the mix and it did cause like, turmoil…</em></p>
<p>Yes, it, id did. It did.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember any other experiences perhaps you had, negative, in terms where xxxx xxxx…</em></p>
<p>My negative experience was er, I…seventy three (1973), seventy (1970), my daughter is born in seventy- so I’m working the dates out for you. In probably, seventy five (1975) I used to work for fire stone, or seventy four (1974). Four, five (1974, 1975). I worked for fire stone er, for the general credit management there. And you used to have I think thirty different, er, towns xxxx xxxx you know where the fire stone companies were. And er, I went there as a temporary and I was working as an admin. And there was this guy, he said to me, I said “oh, I wish I would get a permanent job here, because it’s easier, not far from home.” And he said, “Well, there’s a permanent job going on in the er, credit department, general credit department. And the managers name is McConnell. And I challenge you, he won’t give you the job.” And I said “Why?”. He said, “Because you’re coloured.” I walked in to the office and I said er, I said “Mr McConnell, you don’t know me, I’m doing admin work, I’m temporary I’m from Reed Agency. I’m only here for six months, but I hear there’s a post going on.” And he said “yes, there is.” And I said er, “I know you won’t give me the job.” And he looked at me and he said “I’ll ask you to come for an interview.” So I went for the interview, and I told him “Look I’m challenging you, I want the job. Because I’m coloured, I’m Ugandan you’re not going to give me the job.” And he said “You’ve got the job.” I got the job, and he said to me “You are to wear high heels, tights [laughs] and skirts.” Because I had no choice, I had to go out and buy all those to work with there, but…he used to be in the army in South Africa. British Army, and he used to talk to me about um, the Africans in South Africa, the natives in South Africa, that the natives killed each other in the army. And I said “look, in the army, they are given instructions by the superiors to do that, that’s what- and the superiors were white.” And, somehow along the line, I think he, he liked my challenges, and he was, he became a friend as well.</p>
<p><em>I get the impression he probably wasn’t used to er, a young Asian lady coming to challenge him…</em></p>
<p>Challenge. There were no Asian ladies working in there at all. Er, I think there was only two, and I was the third one. And the others were only on er, very admin jobs.</p>
<p><em>It reminds me I mean, um, when I first went to secondary school I was bullied for two years by this one boy, um I was always the small kid at school and he was quite- as bullies normally are, that he was the big kid. And then, it wasn’t until I actually finally challenged him, after about eighteen months of going home crying everyday…</em></p>
<p>Hmmm. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And I finally challenged him and he’s now my best friend in all the world! [laughs]. He used to bully me for eighteen months [laughs]. Not a day goes past where I don’t let him forget the fact that he used to take my lunch money. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><em>He owes me a few pints over the years! [laughs]</em></p>
<p>Does he? [laughs]. It’s amazing, it’s amazing I think, I just xxxx, that guy hadn’t told me, I would never have got the job, I’ve never moved on, because it was a senior position. It was to the general credit manager, was, a very high position, one of the higher positions, and there are three canteens there. One for the directors, one for the staff, personal staff like we were, and one for the factory workers.</p>
<p><em>The rest? So it, from, not a racial segregation but social segregation [laughs] there. </em></p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p><em>That, that’s Britain. [laughs] It’s the Britain of the sixties and seventies (1960s, 1970s) anyway. Um, so you um, you obvi-, I mean you’ve obviously experienced um, we touched on your experiences in terms of certain negative experiences, and of positive experiences…</em></p>
<p>It was negative, but I’ve taken it very positive because it’s taught me how to deal with people. How to act with people, and it’s, I’ve come a long way with that. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And used it in the future. And um, you also touched on something which I think is quite important, you said, you talked about the relative highs and lows of your husband, and your work and employment, and you said you know, because I think this is important because Ugandan Asian community as we mentioned before the recording, you are as celebrated as the, almost on a pedestal, but as the most high achieving refugee group…</em></p>
<p>Absolutely, they are xxxx…</p>
<p><em>Xxxx say migrant group as well, not just refugee group. I’d say out of all the twentieth century they are held up in very high regard. </em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Be it by governments, politicians, journalists, anyone. Um, people will always refer back to the Ugandan Asian community, and celebrate them as you know, the successful migrant group. </em></p>
<p>Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Why do you think that is?</em></p>
<p>Because Asian, Ugandan Asians have come here and they have moved up. Despite the fact that er, people suffered in their own ways, with depression, with the mental health issues. Or with the separation of the family that didn’t bother them [tuts], I don’t mean bother them, that didn’t let them do nothing, um, they didn’t just feel sorry for them, they moved on. They moved on, they started their own businesses, and they’ve been successful. For example, I went in to community work, charity work. And wow, the first charity work job I got was, I was getting paid, and I never knew that charity workers get paid. Africa we didn’t get paid. Uganda we didn’t get paid. We did charity, xxxx, and that was it. And I thought, oh, that’s good, charity workers get paid. And um, I mean, work and in my work, in my field, since last thirty five, forty years, is working with Ugandan Asians, with Kenyan Asians, or refugees coming in to this country, I find that the Ugandans have done very well. Their children have done very well, their grandchildren have been integrated very well in to the society here. And er, and they are a great contribution to the er, British, er, to the British in, India, in UK.</p>
<p><em>And do you think in terms of um, we joked earlier didn’t we about shop keepers, er, the celebrated nation of shop keepers [laughs]…</em></p>
<p>Nation, yeah.</p>
<p><em>Um, do you think it perhaps also helped the fact, you touch on two things there, first you’ve moved on, do you think the fact that you arrived with nothing…</em></p>
<p>With nothing at all. Nothing at all.</p>
<p><em>It didn’t really allow you to dwell on the past, you were er, basically forced to start again, and you were starting it well, and quickly. Do you think that was an aspect as well? </em></p>
<p>Um, I [sighs]…with me and with my husband it was also the knowledge of the UK, we already had. And also, we wanted to be successful, because we know there was no, no going back. And we didn’t want to be looked down as being given the money. My mother…used to be very upset, when she used to get social security money, she said “this is charity money. I used to give charity, I don’t want this money.” And we used to try and explain to her, it’s not charity, it’s…we used to say her, “you have paid taxes to the British government.” But she couldn’t understand that, she couldn’t, she was not educated, do she couldn’t understand that, but she felt very sad. So really speaking, um, Britain, xxxx Ugandan Asian, and the success is our hard work. Which we are contributing to the Brit. British.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx. </em></p>
<p>It’s all I can say.</p>
<p><em>No, xxxx I think you’ve put that in quite, most beautiful words. </em></p>
<p>[laughs].</p>
<p><em>Um, do you um, do you think your community is quite thankful to the British government, for what they did to you, or, for…</em></p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p><em>Do you think the Ugandan Asian community are thankful to the British government, or British People for what they did, or do you see it as something that naturally would have happened anyway?</em></p>
<p>Um, no, I don’t think we should, er, I am thankful to the British government for what they did, definitely for me. Nothing for my husband, we have worked from nineteen seventy two (1972) to today, we have never been on benefits. We have never er, in fact we have contributed towards the British. But yes, people move, might have been on benefits, and I don’t think they need to be thankful, we were living under the Uganda protection, protectorate, we were protectorate. And Britain has taken a lot of the…their colonies. They took coffee, they took sugar, the barter system, they, Britain has taken the life and soul of the countries. And that’s the way I look at it. And they’re not doing us any favours.</p>
<p><em>And you did say, as a consequence it was their duty…</em></p>
<p>It is their duty, so they not take us any favours, of course it is their, British passport, you have got travel documents, British passport, and if they value their British passport, then they are not running any community, even their own people, even white community they’re not valuing.</p>
<p><em>It’s um, you know, I can never put answers in to people’s mouths but I was hoping you were going to answer like that, because um, the, er, a lot of interviews I’ve done so far, um, but certainly the older generation they are very thankful to the British xxxx, but almost a little bit too thankful, let’s say. And almost sycophantically so, they, they’re not quite, it’s almost as if some members of the Ugandan community have forgotten, like you said so eloquently, that Britain did actually take and take and take, and it was about time they gave, you know [laughs]. You know, as a society. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Um, so, I think it’s just such a wonderful answer. </em></p>
<p>I mean, they are not giving any charity, they’re not giving to the beggars, they’re giving it to their passport holders. That they have allowed to come in to this country, and they have taken the um, what is the right word, I would say is, responsibility of their er, passports.</p>
<p><em>And of course that was very contentious issue, certainly under Callahan with the Kenyans. </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>But then also later, the Ugandan Asians. </em></p>
<p>Ugandan Asians, yes.</p>
<p><em>I think the reality is, as you pointed out, if you, if the British, when it was a British protectorate, they did give out these passports, and therefore, with such passports there are certain privileges, certain rights that you can, can claim. </em></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><em>And that was certainly the rights to have somewhere to live [laughs], when you were finally expelled. </em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>And also let’s face it, I mean Idi Amin himself…</em></p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p><em>Was a priv-, bit of a puppet of the British as well [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>He was, he was. He, well he was in the British Army, we all know what he did, and xxxx repeat xxxx xxxx…</p>
<p><em>That stories been told almost [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Almost over and over again. It is um…I just…I just felt that the Ugandan Asians who were in the camps, were also abused. Er, I read about it in the papers and I used to think, oh my God, what are they doing? I used to hear about people saying that they are being taken in buses to do the work, in, wherever they went to work. And they were paid very little money for it. And that was abuse. And that was taking advantage of people who were suffering, who had suffered. And who were not aware of what is happening. It’s only after ten years, or xxxx so, that people started realising what has happened to them.</p>
<p><em>They almost got carried, sucked in to the machine almost. </em></p>
<p>Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.</p>
<p><em>And do you um, let’s move on, we were actually just touching on the last couple of questions now, so we’ll start winding it up. Um, do you, in terms of Uganda, um, did you say you’d returned, did you say? </em></p>
<p>I went there for one day.</p>
<p><em>One day? I thought it was er…</em></p>
<p>We went, we went there in seventy nine (1979), I was in Kenya, and then we went to Uganda. We were going to stay a few days there, but unfortunately um, we heard that there was going to be some trouble brewing up, and my husband, because of the incident, that he was arrested by, and was put in Mkinde prison. He was only thirty four, we have the same age, him and me, at that time. And er, he wanted to come out. We went to Masaka where our shop was, and stood outside the shop, and I said to my husband, “I want to go inside and see!” And where we had the ladder in the shop, where the till was, it was all there. And I really was dying to go inside, but my husband didn’t let me go, he said if something happens then we have no support. Um, but er, I was chuffed. I travelled through the town of Uganda, I went to the, passed the graveyard, because my eldest sister, one of my sisters is buried there. I went passed our schools, and, um, we didn’t see any Asian people there. There was nobody there. There was one person I knew who would be there but he was out of town. So we came back, and when we came back to Kampala, we were told that it was brewing up, so we left. I was there only one night.</p>
<p><em>One night? But you got to see the house, can you explain perhaps the…</em></p>
<p>I saw…</p>
<p><em>Emotions you felt?</em></p>
<p>I saw the shop from outside. I stood outside. My husband parked the car, and he’s, he sort of parked it, and he said, oh, I’m going to look at it, the tyre has gone flat. Because there was a fear in him, he, and I, I was saying to him, I want to go inside the shop. Because, and I could see my dad’s family in the shop, imagine him. I could see, we used to have a huge safe there, and er, and everything came back to me. Every single thing, er, as a little girl my dad used to bring, put the money in the bags, because he was doing so much business, in bags, xxxx bags. And used to bring it inside the house. And er, we all used to get together and we used count money, and er, my dad used to say, whoever counts the most money I’ll give them xxxx, but we used to nick some as well, he didn’t know that. He still doesn’t know that!</p>
<p><em>[laughs] I won’t tell him! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, he’s gone, he, he’s been gone since the nineteen eighty seven (1987). But what, er, the joys of er, all that, that all came back…</p>
<p><em>Flooding back. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, it all came back. Er, I was very tearful, I was very tearful because I was, the cycles were there, and I knew what spare part was where you know. We had, we used to sell the cycles as well with my dad and you know, with er, the guys who used to work there. I could show you some photos I have afterwards.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx xxxx for that. </em></p>
<p>And er, I mean it did, it did bring back a lot of memories. We did go, we did travel in the town and saw the other houses as well. We had, but just from outside. My husband was very, not wanted to. He just took me to Masaka because, but he, he, because of the experience he had, and that’s xxxx.</p>
<p><em>I think that’s very very justified xxxx…</em></p>
<p>He had a very bad experience and, and it was quite er, frightening experience for him, because he saw so much blood all over the wall, walls in the er, Mkinde, er, prison. And on the floor. And er, I think one of the officers said to him, oh he’s a big man, take him on the top of the roof and throw him, he won’t die! And he kept on saying, I kept on praying to God, oh no, no, don’t throw me I’m human, I’ll die!</p>
<p><em>Xxxx. </em></p>
<p>So he had a very bad experience.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I think that’s completely justified. If you had a certain apprehension, when xxxx. </em></p>
<p>Xxxx So we came back.</p>
<p><em>Erm…</em></p>
<p>XXXX.</p>
<p><em>Did you um, in terms of when, when you, before you went back, did you ever think you were going to go back at any point, did you ever think you’d see Uganda again? </em></p>
<p>I don’t want to go and settle there…</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Because I feel my age doesn’t allow me to settle there. Um, but yes, I want to go back. And, yes I want to see what we had, where we went, what we did, what charity work my dad, my dad did a lot of charity work in Masaka. Um, and he’s got photographs of the xxxx as well, and with the, the Queen, I think the Queen as well I can’t remember where it was but er, some where. When, when she went there, to East African safari or something, a long time ago. So, he was quite a prominent member of Masaka.</p>
<p><em>Do you think it’s um, let’s talk about your identity now, and um, I mean you said, what I found sort of quite interesting, you’ve mentioned while we were talking, you reminiscing about the story of your boss, they, the boss who wasn’t going to give you a job because you were of colour…</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>And you mentioned something when you walked in, I sort of, it stood out, you walked in and you said, you weren’t Asian, you said you were Ugandan. </em></p>
<p>I’ve said I’m Ugandan, I’ve never believed I’m an Asian [laughs]!</p>
<p><em>Yeah, that’s what I was going to ask, what are you as an identity, what do you see yourself now? After all these experiences, having lived in these different places…</em></p>
<p>I am Ugandan, my mother was born there, my grandmother went there, we’ve been there since nineteen eighties (1980s[but think she means 1880s]) to seventy two (1972), yeah, and that’s over a hundred years, nearly a hundred years. Yeah, nearly a hundred years. And yes, maybe we come from Indian subcontinent, but as I say, Ugandan, if something happens to Uganda, my heart misses a beat, if something happens in India, it doesn’t do nothing to me. Or Pakistan. And even my husband, my husband’s parents are born in Pa-, in India, and he will listen to the Indian news, and I have no er, emotions with India at all. And they think I’m funny. But I’m not, because, your mother is always talk to you about Uganda, about Masaka, about her experiences, about her mothers experiences xxxx, how, and her father, but, she lost her parents quite, her mother and father at a young age, so, xxxx about her mother. So how can I say anything about India? I’ve never lived there. The first time I went there was in nineteen ninety five (1995). Just to visit it at somebody’s wedding.</p>
<p><em>So you identify with Uganda in East Africa…</em></p>
<p>I do more.</p>
<p><em>In terms of you as a person xxxx?</em></p>
<p>Me as a person, I do. If something happens to Uganda, or, er, just an example, I met er, there was a guy called er, Williams. He used to work with Richmond Housing Partnership, and I work in Richmond, and I used to have meetings. And he said to me, he’s from Masaka, he was born in Masaka. I nearly died! This black African. I nearly died, and for ten years we worked, we met each other at meetings and places, and he would always come and hold my hand, and said to me, Dugu Dugoons [sp?], sister. Uganda, African Ugandan, saying to an Asian woman, and at one point one Asian lady said to me, “oh, you are a very loose character”, she xxxx lady. “You allow a black man to hold your hand.” And it was an Asian lady, she was an elderly lady, but she was from Africa. And er, my answer to her was, that “he was born in the same town I was.” You know when you meet somebody who is born in the same town as you, you nearly die, in another well, country you know. And secondly, “he’s called me a Dukuwe, he’s calling me a sister, and he can hold my hand, I’m not bothered!”</p>
<p><em>He’s my brother!</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Full stop. I was er, we had a very good relationship, until he’s moved on to another job, and then you know, the distance. But he’s still in touch with me.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. So, I mean your heart is, it lies xxxx…</em></p>
<p>My heart lies with Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>My heart lies with Uganda. I would love to go to that beautiful climate [laughs].</p>
<p><em>Yeah, well, I was going to say, the weather is certainly [laughs]…</em></p>
<p>Yeah xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p><em>We’ve talked about your identity then, let’s talk about the identity of your, you have children you mentioned…</em></p>
<p>I’ve got children, two a girl and a boy. My daughter is nearly forty now, and my son is thirty six, xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Let’s talk about, let’s talk that generation, the children of the exodus, let’s say, or certainly, the next generation of the people who left. Um, do they identify with Uganda at all, do they…</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>Identify with the story, that you, the process…</em></p>
<p>Um, they know, they hear it, they take it as an experience and that is it. That’s it with them. Um, my son and my daughter would like to go to Uganda. My daughter did go to Kenya, she, it was three years ago, she went er, she climbed Kilimanjaro, she raised er, money for water aid. And I think they raised about seven thousand pounds.</p>
<p><em>Wow. </em></p>
<p>Um, and er, I think she did very well, she went to the top, and she said to me, “mum, I have never seen so many stars in the world.” In the evening, the sky in Uganda…</p>
<p><em>Did it remind you of…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Did it remind you of home when she said that? </em></p>
<p>Yeah. Well she came and told me she said “Oh, that must be Uganda for you too.” Because you know, in the evening you have stars, you don’t see stars here.</p>
<p><em>Especially this close to the airport! [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>We don’t see as many stars here, and if there is any star I just sit outside and watch it, because in the evening you used to sit and watch the stars.</p>
<p><em>Yeah of course. Do you think it’s important that perhaps the children, and even their, their children or grandchildren, is it important that their aware of the process you went through, or do you think it’s a story that should be left?</em></p>
<p>No, I think they should be aware, this is why I have written a lot of things, and my father has written, I’ve kept it in a book, my son knows where it is. But the problem with the children now, is that…when my children were born, we were busy settling ourselves down. Yeah, my daughter was born, we didn’t even have a house, we didn’t have no money, we never went on holidays, we never did anything, we were just settling outsiders in this country. And er, taking children to school, bringing, we had no time. No time to tell the stories. Now, that they are older and they are, there I’m penning it down for them, so they know. They know quite a little bit from the conversations, but it’s, it’s not them that’s gone through it.</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>It’s…they are very British, they will call themselves British, English, born in England.</p>
<p><em>So in the same way you identify with Uganda xxxx…</em></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><em>They will only ever identify perhaps with England.</em></p>
<p>Exactly. And it’s their Queen, it’s not our Queen, their Queen.</p>
<p><em>XXxx. </em></p>
<p>Don’t forget that.</p>
<p><em>That’s true, it’s true as well. Unfortunately you both pay for her, xxxx [laughs]. </em></p>
<p>[laughs].</p>
<p><em>You don’t have a choice in that!</em></p>
<p>[laughs]. No choice!</p>
<p><em>Er, we’re just going to touch upon the last couple of er things now. Um obviously, um, I mean this is a question I ask everyone. Um, but I mean, I’m, I, I’m interested to know how you think the fortieth anniversary should be celebrated. Um, but with you, you’ve actually, you’ve already told me that you think, um, obviously it’s important for your grandchildren and children to know. Um, but also you joined the core committee so you obviously have an interest in the celebrations [laughs]. How do you think it should be celebrated, is it, I mean, do you think it should be celebrated nationally, by perhaps both white, the Anglo population, as well as the Ugandan Asian community. Do you think this is a story that should be celebrated by the nation?</em></p>
<p>I think the success is always c-, success always comes after hardship. Hmm. And Ugandan Asians…with just those three months of expulsion, was hard. Was very difficult. And the success in this country needs to be celebrated, not forgetting the hardships. Not forgetting the experiences of leaving, it’s not only one community, there were Punjabis, Guajaratis, er, Ismalis, Ismali were also a prominent community there as well. There wer other comm-, Farsi community, there were other minorities as well there, and I think they need to be er, also, included in this. In this moment what I find, that we are constantly xxxx very much to Jinja people, they’re not looking, there is Masaka, there is Uganda, there’s Abrara, there’s Kampali. There’s little towns, there are people who lived in little villages. And their, their er, successes are not being ign-, er, are not being taken in to account. It’s fine to say that, ok, for example, I’m not going to name, Ashi is an Epi, Ashi is from Uganda, and the world is going to come down to Ashi with their stories all the time. It’s not about that. It’s about grass root people, who suffered the most. And that is what is being ignored now. I don’t know whether you agree to that or not, but I feel that, because when I went to the first meeting, I brought up that question.</p>
<p><em>Well, I, this is no um, certain disrespect to the core committee, or Praful, Mr Praful Patel himself, who I work, I told you I have a lot of respect for him, but I think, we’re quite aware at Eastside, um that Praful is helping us get interviews, however the interviews he’s getting us are, tend to be diplomats, functionaries, celebrated people…</em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>And I mean, it’s, it’s something we’re very aware of ‘cause Eastside has never done that. The organisation I work for, we’ve always, what we do, even our website is called “hidden histories”…</em></p>
<p>Hmmm?</p>
<p><em>“Hidden History”</em></p>
<p>Hidden History?</p>
<p><em>So, yeah, so the histories of people who are often overlooked, ignored or hidden away. You know, so that’s why we work with people, with disabilities, we’ve, I mean the first project I did with the organisation was disability, er, history month, and we did an exhibition. And we talked about how able bodied and disabled bodied workers actually work together in unison in factories in east London. You know, we’ve done er work with um Bengali communities as well. </em></p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p><em>Um, a number of the er, groups that xxxx are overlooked. And yeah, I think when we first signed up for this MOU with Praful, we had to make Praful quite aware that we’ve got to tell the story of the people of the resettlement camp. The, the man who owns the shop in Leytonstone, you know, the, the guy who worked a double shift at the airport at night, through, for his children or xxxx did a shift in the cash and carry in the daytime. These are the Ugandan Asians that we want to represent and tell the story of. Er, so yeah, I think we are aware of that as well. I can certainly see um, your observations in terms of Praful and the core committee, does seem xxxx…</em></p>
<p>I mean he’s a lovely guy, when I went there, really I realise he used to study with my sister.</p>
<p><em>[laughs] Yeah. </em></p>
<p>I brought my sister up and I said look your colleague is here! [laughs].</p>
<p><em>He’s one hell of a character, I tell you that, he’s really xxxx xxxx…</em></p>
<p>He was xxxx xxxx he wanted me to organise the meetings, but they all are about five thirty, five or six o clock. And I can’t make it. In, er, from Hounslow to go all the way there, I’ve got my meetings as well to attend.</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>Which is, I think, my choice because I do charity work and voluntary work…</p>
<p><em>That’s and that’s your priority. </em></p>
<p>Yeah. That’s er…</p>
<p><em>I think er, you know, it, it’s just, it is quite important to, er, and I, I think the reason I addressed that for you is not for the point of the interview or…</em></p>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p><em>It’s really to make sure you’re aware that what we do with this, will not…</em></p>
<p>No, I’m sure, I’m sure…</p>
<p><em>Xxxx xxxx. </em></p>
<p>I , no, but I would like, I, I tell you what, I will give you, I did oral history project about er, eighty nine, ninety (1989, 1990). And I recorded stories of people. That’s xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx xxxx. </em></p>
<p>I’ve got, I’ve got one lady, I can hear her story…and I can take you to her, she’s ninety now, eighty nine, ninety.</p>
<p><em>If you could help me…</em></p>
<p>I’ll take you to her, er, she was…do not, believe it or not, she was er, er, you know my, because I was one of the youngest, this er, there’s a huge age gap of nineteen years between my elder brother xxxx to me. And the things that happened, his time, when my mum got married and she was living in this er, my dad’s uncle’s house, and there was a little girl there, and my mum always said, her name was Amita, and my mum always said, that er, uncle’s wife used to ill treat her. And um, she was mixed race, Muslim father, Muslim Pakistani father, and black mother. And she was ill treated. And, do you know what, when I went to, when I did this work, I had to say stop, because she took my dad’s name. I did, I’d never seen her. Like I said, you know because of that age gap, that nineteen year gap, I had never seen her. I was somewhere else, brought up, I had heard of her from my mum, never seen her. And she took my dad’s name, I said “cut!” And I said to her, “you know you are talking about my father?” “Oh!” she said to me, she said “you’re xxxx daughter?” You know, my father’s, I said “yes.” And she, she was giving the story how she was treated by er, Asian people, because she was half caste. And how she, felt at home here in England because she was xxxx xxxx. I’ve got that history, er, and I still support her.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx wonderful. </em></p>
<p>She thinks the world of me. Because…</p>
<p><em>Xxxx, if you, if she’s come forward xxxx short interview, um, or even just be sitting down, chatting with her, or if not…</em></p>
<p>She can do the interview with you, and I’ll give you her, I’ll give you her tape. Um, but promise me you’ll give it back to me.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, what I’m going, um, what I’m going to do is, um, once we’ve finished xxxx…</em></p>
<p>It’s one of the old tapes, you know.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, completely. What I’ll do is once we’ve done, I’ve got one more question left, we’ll stop the recorder, and then, I mean, I’m going to sort of perhaps wrap it up, because I appreciate you’re giving me a lot of your time…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx don’t worry about me, xxxx enough…</p>
<p><em>I’m doing, yeah, of course, exactly you’re bored now [laughs], we’ve xxxx xxxx. But what we’ll do is, we do have an online archive, um, for photographs and audio. Um, so really, I mean, I won’t take anything off you tonight, but because…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll have a look for them.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, exactly, and I want you to feel comfortable. And also, what I’d like to do is bring paperwork that you can sign, so that when I do, what I will have to do, I will have to take it away and scan it in the office. </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>But I can promise you I’ll give it back to you within twenty four hours. And you’ll have the receipt, and then we’ll bring it back, so you’ll know if it’s gone missing. So as long as you can trust us with it, um, and also, I’d like to bring a protective bag with me, rather than just take it and stick it in my bag. </em></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><em>So we’ll organise that, perhaps, afterwards. I’m going to touch on the last question now, um, it’s [laughs], it’s a question I always, it’s a default question I always put in towards the end, and it’s um, your opportunity perhaps to send out a message to a certain individual who I know, You’re probably sick of his name, it’s Mr Amin. Um, if I, if Mr Amin was sitting here now…</em></p>
<p>Who, Idi Amin?</p>
<p><em>Idi, yeah. What would your message be to him, in terms of the way he treated your people, in terms of what happened with the legacy, um, do you think you’d have words for him?</em></p>
<p>I’m just going to tell you about Sufi and I, um, xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, the um, last king of Scotland.</em></p>
<p>The Last King Of Scotland, my husband, my son bought me the ticket, and he said “mum, you must go and see this movie”, and we went. Sufi and I went, and the moment the actor came as Idi Amin, I think the thirty seven years of frustration which we had never discussed with anybody, or talked about it, amongst ourselves. Brought my husband and I was, some but the truth of it, it’s not that, yeah, there was a lot of truth in the movie. We cried throughout, both of us. It brought a lot of emotions out, it brought a lot of feelings out, and I think it did me a lot of good because I had hidden lot of feelings, lot what happened in the family, what happened when we left, we had no money, you know, things-, it was hard. And it did. My message to Idi Amin would be; if you are alive today, I would be, I would like to ruin you…and I would like to do things to you that you did it to people, and see how you feel.</p>
<p><em>Xxxx, I think the phrase is, a taste of his own medicine. </em></p>
<p>Yes, taste of your own medicine.</p>
<p><em>Hmm. </em></p>
<p>Yes er, it destroyed families, but then he destroyed his own wives, he destroyed his own, so he was a ruthless person. He destroyed families, he destroyed emotions, he…destroyed everything people had in just one little speech of his.</p>
<p><em>You, I think, the one thing I will say though actually is um, if, if, it’s not necessarily vengeance, but if it gives you any sort of comfort, it is, I think when you do eventually go to the afterlife, hopefully in a few years time [laughs], I think you’re going to be surrounded by your friends and family, I am pretty sure that Idi Amin dies a very lonely…</em></p>
<p>Well, we heard that yes, yeah. I know, I know…</p>
<p><em>And it might not make up [phone starts ringing] for what he did to you, but er, I think that’s a sign of what kind of person he is. Please. [phone continues to ring]</em></p>
<p>Xxxx call you back yeah? No, I’ll call you back in a minute [hangs up phone].</p>
<p><em>Um yeah, so I think he eventually got his comeuppance. I mean I know the…</em></p>
<p>Yeah, he left, he er, I know he was at peace with himself you know.</p>
<p><em>I don’t think so, xxxx. </em></p>
<p>Somebody who is that cruel and xxxx…</p>
<p><em>I don’t think anyone could be xxxx…</em></p>
<p>Does such horrible things, if he could eat his wife’s heart, what’s Asian community to him?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, it’s true, it’s true. You were just another victim…</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Of a man who was quite ruthless. </em></p>
<p>Victim of the British government, because he was British government’s puppet.</p>
<p><em>It’s true, it’s true. Um…</em></p>
<p>So that’s what it was.</p>
<p><em>I think [laughs]…</em></p>
<p>And it back fired xxxx xxxx.</p>
<p><em>Well this is my point, the thing about you, we mentioned it earlier about the British colonial powers and what they did, the way they ravaged the, large territories across the world.</em></p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><em>Er, I mean er, especially through that film, and I know as you say, it’s not completely historically accurate, but certain aspects are true, and what I found was really prevalent in the film, was quite shocking, was the role Britain had after independence. You know, it seemed like a very faux independence, it seemed like the old colonial powers still…</em></p>
<p>British plays games with it’s colonies. Britain, just feels that because they were a powerful nation, they can walk over everything. And that’s what they’ve been doing…</p>
<p><em>And got away with it for quite a long while…</em></p>
<p>They did it in India. [laughs]. They did it everywhere.</p>
<p><em>I think if we’re going to list of the countries we’ve affected as a colony then [laughs], I won’t get home tonight will I?!</em></p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, you know, it’s not necessarily a British disease, it’s a colonial disease, because you know, the British colonial powers have gone, but who moved in, the next power comes along, and once America dies, the next one will come in. </em></p>
<p>Of course, of course.</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately it’s this is a story that…</em></p>
<p>It’s an ongoing thing isn’t it.</p>
<p><em>It’s a story of our history as a people isn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Actually, I think I’m, I’m going to turn off the recording device now. Thank you ever so much for your time. </em></p>
<p>You’re welcome, I hope, I hope you got something xxxx, it’s very distorted.</p>
<p><em>I’m going to tell you something now, um, and I promise you, I’m not exaggerating now, I’m going to turn it off…</em></p>
