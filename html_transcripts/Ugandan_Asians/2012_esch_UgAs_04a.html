<p><em>OK. So this is Lwam Tesfay, from Eastside Community Heritage interviewing Vinod Tailor, on seventeenth of December two thousand and twelve. OK, so if you can just um, begin with telling me your, date of birth and where you were born? </em></p>
<p>OK. I was born in fifty seven. And… born in Uganda, um…we were, living, in a small town outside of Kampala and er, during, the crisis of nineteen seventy two, when Idi Amin decided that the, Asians must leave the country within the ninety days. Um…having lived in a small town what had happened was that, OK of course the ninety day limit was there, and um…I had, I was the eldest then I’ve got three sisters and a brother. Now what happened was that the town of the village we lived in, was also nearby was a military camp.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>Now the military was basically, told to do, rampage and go wild as and when they felt. So… I, my father’s house was there but it wasn’t big enough. So, my sisters and that XXXX I use to go to a relative’s house…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>…to sleep at night. Now during that one night there, and this er, ninety day was already in progress…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>a next door neighbour, um… we use to have corrugated sheet houses, they were not concrete houses.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>So corrugated sheet houses, and… what had happened was that, military at about two a.m early hours of the morning, they came in and they started shooting. And obviously, they went next door because they knew there’s a young lady there.</p>
<p>[Telephone rings]</p>
<p>So…they wanted to rape her. And er…obviously, didn’t happen so they shot her.</p>
<p><em>You, you were there?</em></p>
<p>I was in the house next door.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And you could hear the bullets, you know, just going through because you know, they were firing, just like, mad people and either they were drunk, the, you know the military or you know, drugs, or whatever it may be. And then they shot the father of the girl as well, er… the brother tried to protect and he…had er… wounds on his legs, but he was OK. So, that…you know, moment after that two a.m incident, that first thing in the morning…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>… the whole town of Asians whatever there weren’t many anyway…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>… in that little village. Everybody just decided, at the dawn of the morning, just pack up and leave. So we all went to Kampala…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>… try and get a ticket. Try and queue up with the British High Commission and see what was the first exit. And when they left the comiss…so we just left everything as it is. Even the workers we didn’t tell them…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>… what was, what was we just left.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Just take your passports, and off you go.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And, so that’s how we arrived in Kampala… then the journey, from the airport to the airport, from Kampala all of us also was very frightening because, you had lots of checkpoints.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>… and the military would see all your ‘oh, you’re OK you’re wearing a necklace? OK. You’re wearing…bangles? [snatch sound effect]. So…</p>
<p><em>Take it off?</em></p>
<p>So, XXXX just, you just had to give it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Because you wouldn’t dare, say anything. And then, is what happened during that time. Now…yes, the Asians that there were there, we all moved into schools and everything else but there were not, they were just like normal secondary schools…</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>…as you have it here in this country, so there was no private education, of course they were fee-paying…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…schools. But there wasn’t like private education and a free education so you didn’t that differential. So one fine day, then anyway we managed to get out, and get on the flight. We arrived at Stansted, and the moment we arrived at Stansted, there was a er, Ugandan resettlement board had been created. People came that looked us, took us. The next thing is, that you…we were put on a coach and taken to Suffolk. That was where we went of course not knowing what UK was about…</p>
<p><em>Mm</em>.</p>
<p>…what. We ended up in Suffolk we went to this camp, a lot of, few coaches or whoever arrived that day, there was a two hundred people, two hundred fifty people on the flight, so we were all down. Then many flights started coming in, and everybody was brought in. And then, the camps were dotted around, um…but, the thing was that, even when arrived…of course we were all frightened, experience of particularly personal, like my father who lived and worked and hoped that he was gonna die in that country. And never have of thought that he would have to come to UK.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And suddenly, it’s a shock, of culture, shock of, the weather… shock of everything because there’s, whatever it is, he…he was fine. They were happy. We were there in the camp, at Suffolk and obviously you… were trying, it was like a dormitory.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>You know there was long…</p>
<p><em>Like halls?</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes there was a big dormitory just everybody was just, so many beds were lined up like a hospital. There was no rooms for everybody and just did, nobody had room, you just… stayed there.</p>
<p><em>Like it was like a one, big…</em></p>
<p>Yeah yeah one big hall, open plan…</p>
<p><em>Of beds?</em></p>
<p>So that…</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>…beds everywhere. So that’s how it was, and then they gave us a couple of pounds, there was second hand clothing given. Winter clothing given because it was October.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And… we just had to take that, and then they asked what skills we had, or what, what we could do, how it could be done. And, like… for example, we had maternal uncle, my mum’s brother who… said ‘OK, what we gonna do with this? How long’? And then obviously were, he went to the board and found out what is happening, what they’re doing. And…people just started to say ‘OK fine’, and uncle said ‘look…there is a possibility of a job in Luton...</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…and there’s another relative, apparently there…from the community and he says that, there are vacancies’. So… OK fine, we just did, and we, my uncle said ‘look why don’t you move with me now’, so we in moved in with him in Finchley.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And my dad went to Luton, started to work and lived those relatives, and once the job was there and he found it, then immediately within two three weeks we…he found a rented place….</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>… and we went to the rented place. It was two bedrooms, not two bed, two rooms. And two rooms rented, and um…we lived there, and five of us, seven of us. Five um…siblings…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>…and my parents. In those days, you use to have these slot machines for your gas and your electricity.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And there was no central heating as such…</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>so you had these paraffin heaters. So you knew, what would happen if you put in the ten p. You can get gas for ‘x’ amount of time of electricity so there was no television or anything.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>We didn’t have anything, and… because we came in the winter, um…we literally were in bed by six p.m, because there was nothing else to do. It was cold, we couldn’t afford to put up the heating and all that.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>And that was that, and mum found a job as well. And um.. she was working for a company which made clothes for infants. And… she would come, and… because it would get dark by five p.m and she finishes… and she would get lost, because every house looked the same.</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS]</em></p>
<p>Unless you knew the name of the street, and you named the house number it was difficult so she’d get lost. You’d try and find her… and trying to get into schools, and because we came after the term already started in September…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So it was all of this kind of things that were there, but… it was difficult, but same time we said ‘OK, we’ll make the ends meet’. And my father was earning nineteen pounds and ten pence, and every Friday he use to get this little envelope with your cash, cheque in… there was no cheques, cos you would get, get paid, you know by cash.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And eleven pounds was rent. So we had eight pounds ten pounds left, for seven of us to live on the week. So, that is how the journey started, and I, use to have to go to school because I was still not sixteen.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>You wouldn’t. So you’d get your part-time job, and in those days you use to have Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thursday and Friday were late night shoppings, and they’d close at eight o’clock. So you went from five til eight, so three hours…on Friday, three hours on…so sorry, Thursday, Friday, three and three hours and then, you did your eight hours on Saturday. And you would get paid about two pounds fifty or something like that.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And um… that’s what I was doing, cos others were younger than me so they couldn’t work. And um… it was a challenge. But that challenge became… more challenging as soon I got to the age of sixteen, I… I passed my er… C-S-E in er… Guajarati… and I think, Geography, or something like that, but I mean results were no important to me neither was any education important to me. Initially the aspirations were to be a doctor and all that, but that was, Uganda days. But it was not to be. So you started working… and out of the five us, I think my, er… one of the sisters she, she is…um…she went to do A levels.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And, um… she was the highest educated amongst us. And then she xxx Radiography Luton Dunstable Hospital. Then of course, she got married and settled, she’s the Head of Radiography in Milton Keynes now. And the other one, became a Librarian, the one, the elder xxx the one younger to me, she got married to a teacher and then, she was working for some companies and, she never did um, A Levels or anything like that.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>….either. So they were all, then I had to take up the responsibility and, because of the change of the weather and everything, so my father started suffering from arthritis…and um, then he had, because of the arthritis tablets that created complication with his heart</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So the responsibilities fell on me very quickly so I had to grow up very quick. So of course, the job in Tesco had to continue. Then as soon as I got sixteen I…then applied to Natwest.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And the job was almost like a paperboy, or, very low.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>It was er, about eight hundred and sixty four pounds a year. I use to pay two hundred and fifty pound train ticket. Out of that…taxes were high, and that’s the way I started my career in that bank. But I still had to continue that job and I even worked in a Bureau de Change…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>…in er…in Oxford Street. So I use to continue with three jobs, because you still had to continue the ends meet, the cost of, marriages, my sisters, all of those things were sort of, there, I could see, that I had to put up. And we where then given a council house</p>
<p><em>Yep.</em></p>
<p>To move from the rental to a council house, then council house eventually we bought and then…that’s how it all, moved on. But the responsibility fell very early stage of my life, um…do I have any regrets? No, I think that made me a better person, to understand what, what was wasn’t…there were challenges.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Er… there was, you could see some prejudices that were there, but we never took prejudices as a negative thing… or you know, specific XXXX. Anybody, you know, coming to the country and then taking over, there would be some resentment and we accepted that…</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>…that would be resentment because you go back to…wherever back to India, or you go back to Eritrea, you go and you feel like…oh they’ll say ‘OK, here she comes from London now. She think she knows it all’.</p>
<p><em>Mm. [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>There's an immediate barrier.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>They never regard you as their own. And that’s, that’s the same thing that is within India as well.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So you had that, and then, you say ‘OK, well… I really truly want to help but what can I do because you’re not going to accept me’, they think you are educated, you are learned so you are there just to give them a lip service and then leave. But that’s not what everybody does, maybe some do. Um... but that was a great experience. Then I moved along in my banking career because I wanted to XXXX I did find, bit of resistance in terms of er… prejudice, there was little bit of it. But again, as I said to you earlier…I did not take it as a wrong thing. That yes, they are entitled to say what they’re saying because I’m in…</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>…their country, taking things away from them. The council house will be given to one of them.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Here I am, because we were five, because in the points system we came up higher so we got it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Um… you know, so I did feel bad for them, and never it took XXXX, we got to get on with it and I just did, I, we just took up challenges and moved on. And said ‘alright, how could I better my life’? The question was that. Within that time also, um…I’ again, I’m talking about myself this time, is that, alright, I’ve got the opportunity. What would have happened if it didn’t, and you start thinking, and then I felt that alright, do we now…what do we about the culture, this country. OK we accept the British culture but the same time, I think… it would be nice to keep your own identity as well. Because that would make, Britain a better place, because it will bring in, er…a different kind of cultures, it would bring maybe, society a bit more cosmopolitan. And there’s a lot of learning to be done by the British too. Because there were lot of goodness’s in us that they needed to learn, the, you know, the family values and things like that. Which they had…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>During the Victorian age, probably did, but as society evolved there was also getting less, church was, church going was getting less and even if you look at it today, I mean it’s the Africans that keep the churches going. Because you don’t see the British British has done, some of them do go.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>But a lot of them not, that’s why a lot of churches were sold off, um…to, turn into mosques or…turn into seven Adventist…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…or some sort of Christian faith, or, whatever odd temples and gurdwara whatever it is. So, the advantage of this country was, that, they have been very liberal in letting you practice your faith. You wanted to work hard, please go ahead. Nobody stopped you. If you wanted to take the advantage of the education, do better for yourself it was there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I mean, in those days, university fees didn’t exist. They were free.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Right. So there was huge amount of opportunities, that this country gave and I think you had your, even despite us complaining today when about NHS and that, but, once you’re there they do take care of you, the system works. I do have, I don’t believe there’s anybody that can say ‘well, I’m in the state of starvation, where’ve I've got nothing nothing nothing’.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But there are people out of choice that they do it. But, a majority of them, I think are, have something at least. And I think that’s the good part of this…er, society. There is very tolerant on faith, their tolerant, on speech, there is democracy, er, whatever it works or not it doesn’t matter but it’s there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And I think that’s the greatest part of Britain, I think that is what it is. And having seen, through my banking career, that, going from retail banking which is you know, Natwest and then into international banking…then into investment banking, then into private banking. I've done the rim of the banking, um....and again, through hard work, honesty and a lot of grace, er, from above, I think, I was able to do…er…</p>
<p>[Telephone rings]</p>
<p>…what I wanted to do.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And er…again, opportunities were there then, as time evolved, you, you start to give back to society, you get involved more in the society. and you do whatever you can. And at the time of doing it, it’s not necessarily, you do it as a British, you do it as… XXXX I want to give back. And yes, I do try and do charities in India, I do work in Africa with charities in Africa as well. Um, quite a lot of charities in Africa in fact, and there is more aspiration to do more as time goes by.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. That’s really interesting. Um, I kinda wanted to go a little bit back towards your experience in, in Uganda. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What did your father do?</em></p>
<p>My, we had a small tailoring shop.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>So he used to do, made-to-measure suits, shirts, trousers and things like that. That’s how it was, it was him. He would do the cutting of the…the thing and then there would be, couple of workers who would stitch up, the trousers on that. So that is what it was. Um…and but it was like, a small shop, so it wasn’t like, you know he was going to ever become very very wealthy or anything like that but, it was good to give you a decent life.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>So that’s how it was, and then, I say when I look back, had we not come, what would I have done, based on that, the cost of education, um…what I have continued to study further? I don’t know.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>Right. So that’s why coming to this country, opened up many many opportunities. Even for me, even though, I didn’t do further education, but certainly for my brothers, my sisters, there was opportunity for them. Because they knew that they could, XXXX that something to fall back on. It wasn’t pressure on them to go and get…work, start working immediately.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So that was the advantage.</p>
<p><em>Do, do you remember when um…Idi Amin made the announcement?</em></p>
<p>Yes, we were aware of when the announcement was made. People thought, that no he wouldn’t be serious, but as time went by, like I told you with the killing and everything else and, more horrendous reports coming out from different parts of Uganda. So we knew that time had come to leave now. There wasn’t much, either you play around with your life</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Or you just accept it and move on. And we did.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever anticipate, once, once he came into power, anticipate that, you would ever, ever leave Uganda before that?</em></p>
<p>See the thing is again, and now er…if you look a Uganda, as I said, nobody envisaged that. And then nobody does in any part of the world, you know. Whether you’re from any part of, you know, whether you came from Eritrea or wherever. We didn’t leave because of choice.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>If the trouble was not there, would we have left the answer is no. Would you have left Eritrea if XXXX, would your mother have left?</p>
<p><em>Probably not, of course not.</em></p>
<p>No, so that’s what I’m saying. So, the circumstances, of the time has made us move, and migrate to wherever. And again, as I said, we were very fortunate because I have been very fortunate to travel across, the globe I would say. And believe me, I lived in other places, worked for a British bank, Americans, and Japanese but my experiences are that what Great Britain, and I don’t call it United Kingdom, what Great Britain gives you is tremendous. And I , despite the weather, despite everything else believe me, after a little while. You feel no, no, no I want to go back.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Right, because of the tolerancy, because of the vibrancy, because of the cosmopolitan. and, culturally also you can enrich yourself so much.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>You know, and the education system…</p>
<p>[TELEPHONE RINGS]</p>
<p>…like I said, not like, at the moment British Library, you got this mogul art exhibition from India.</p>
<p><em>India yeah.</em></p>
<p>You know, its brilliant, XXXX so, there is so much opportunity. In this country I think, it’s what you want to make of yourself you can go ahead and do it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Er…even compared to other countries in the west, the advantage you and I had was, because we speak English. So we know that, we know that there’s a common law, there is some sort of system, alright. But the systems were there when we came in it was even much better, because the cost of living was cheaper so you could afford to do a lot of things. You see house prices were low.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Right, so one could get onto, the ladder, but relative, again, to the income…that time. So, incomes have gone up, but, have we improved the quality of our lives to…to compensate, I don’t think so. I think er, you know the society has evolved and er, a lot of things. I think um, as you would probably ask your mum that she was working but she was working but she was very happy to do it, she would enjoy to get up to do some work. And, despite having siblings and she would still um, be one bread winner but she was happy and, all the family would be happy. Today I think, we got everything but we got yet, nothing I think people have lost this…um, comfort of joy and happiness that was there before I think, industalise, industrialisation also, has created issues with it because I think and the way, the corporates think as well so we, become sort of…slaves, of greed, or economic claves, so even in the education I think er…yes it is there but I think education also has evolved, because before we use when I, when we came in the seventies it was technical colleges, and you had er… you know, apprenticeships.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And that all went out of the window, er… as time went by and I think we need to get back to that kind of thing to, to be able to give, offer the future generations something, some values.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And I think that’s very important.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember your first day at school in the UK?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I remember going to the school and as I said it was, erm…you had to take a bus to go to the school. You go to the school, your completely in new environment, em…</p>
<p><em>Was this in Luton?</em></p>
<p>It was in Luton, and er… you know and you try and get into the system, and er…should of, OK, the syllabus were different…</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>…and you’rE just trying to make it with the same time you had this thing at the back of your mind that, OK, I need to be in school because I’m not sixteen.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But, it wasn’t, something that I enjoyed.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Because there were, many pressing things that you needed to get on with…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…Of like feeding the stomach.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So you wonder, what do you do, and you were not even aware of whether you can claim this or claim this and claim that kind of benefits we just went xxx, you know just did what you could.</p>
<p><em>So you were kind of looking forward towards to working?</em></p>
<p>We, ya, because of I knew, that er, you know we had to work, because otherwise how as a family, we would disintegrate. So you had more of it, not towards, me as such, but you look at it as ‘we’.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>And there was no ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘mine’. It was everything was ‘we’. You see so, it was the group as, you know, a family we did that and er… ya, it was amazing going to school, even the first day at work er… going and finding a job and er…</p>
<p><em>How did you find that, how did find the job?</em></p>
<p>We basically, somebody in the school knew and I just turned up one day and asked them for a job so they said yeah you can do cleaning, I said ‘yeah OK fine’, cleaning so be it, you know sweeping the, the shop floor and things like that. So yeah, take it on. I did it. um…and then as you grow, you know, you stand stacking the shelves and you’re stacking the shelves then you’re stacking and do it, you know selling department, you were looking after that. So, but it was fun, erm… in trying to understand because that gave me insight into working hard. You understood the values of working, but at the same time you had to keep your ethics. You, you had to have some principles in life. To be able to, to do that. And of course there was no Sunday opening which was great, because it gave time to…to think about and be with the family as a whole, and planning things.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. What was the area like in Luton? When you first arrived arrived, where there a lot of other Ugandan Asian families in that area?</em></p>
<p>No I think er… majority of the Asians are… of course, some came to London because as a capital and a lot of things, so depending on where, if there were relatives where you lived. A lot of them went to Leicester.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>A lot of the community went to Leicester. Again, because of the relatives, but also, Leicester being a textile place. So a lot of these Ugandan Asians, they all knew how to stitch up, so they all went for that. And there was XXXX imperial typewriters…</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>The olden typewriters, so yeah, they were, they were recruiting and expanding and all of those things get jobs, there were certain amount of community that went into businesses, created shops and things like that. Yeah, so…Leicester, then Birmingham also because of the, you know, huge Sikh community.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So some went there as well. And then some went as far as Scotland.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>So depending on what they were looking, what kind of job, so some did, and I said we were blessed that OK we had relatives.</p>
<p><em>Did you ever experience any, kind of negative experiences when you were living in Luton? Or any incidents of racism, or prejudice?</em></p>
<p>No, not at such, as I told you. Erm… you could notice of it because of trying to you going for a job whereas as somebody else who has you know, lived, born this country were also looking for a job. So you do, you did notice resentment. But, as I said I never took that resented, resentment as a negative or bad thing. I said ok, they are right to make that resentment. But that means that I will have to make myself always better than them, to be able to succeed.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>I knew, that that is there, so…but I cannot say ‘hey, you are discriminating against me’ cos I wasn’t in that game, I just said ‘no, OK fine’, I can’t get a job there then fine but I need to find a job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So whatever it was. It was not, to us…it was like you have to get a job. There was no description that I have to this job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Whatever came along, you took it and you moved on.</p>
<p><em>OK</em></p>
<p>So It was a job, it wasn’t you know, rather than…</p>
<p><em>A career or anything?</em></p>
<p>So that, that was our first working experience.</p>
<p><em>And your fam…your, you said your siblings and your brothers and sisters, did they all follow the same sort of route. I know you explained earlier about, you know, they’ve alone to difference areas, did they all have the same work ethic?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I think they did. But they were much, they were younger so….I mean, they were twelve, they were ten, eight and five or six years of age. So yeah, so they, they knew that we’re in a different place. We, they knew that we have to make within that, one breadwinner. Mum was earning five pounds or eight pounds something like that a week.</p>
<p><em>This is where she was working in er…</em></p>
<p>In one of those tailors, you know the infant…er clothes making company.</p>
<p>OK, and what was your dad doing then?</p>
<p>He was in, in in in…</p>
<p><em>Same?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, but he was in a different er…company.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>He was in a different company, doing same kind of tailoring work. Stitching and things like that. But the fact was that, as I said to you. We, I had to grow up very quickly…because the responsibilities, because of, you knowing my dad’s health…and then thinking that OK, maybe one day, he may not be able to work and then what?</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>So I had to grow up very quickly.</p>
<p><em>What there any time where you felt, you wish you was back in Uganda straight away?</em></p>
<p>No, erm…I, for me, no it didn’t cross like that but for my father yes because he suddenly came here and said ‘why do I have to wear an overcoat’?</p>
<p><em>[Laughs]</em></p>
<p>‘Why do I have to do this? Why this? Why this’? So there was a lot of this kind of resentment because Uganda, whatever was said and done, it was…you know, you had little but you were happy.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I mean, you truly were happy…today you have everything but you’re not happy because you’re still in…search for more.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I agree.</em></p>
<p>So there was more contentment, in, in the earnings in Uganda.</p>
<p><em>What about your mum, how did she find the, em… when she came to UK. You said your dad didn’t like the weather… </em></p>
<p>She didn’t like the weather, of course getting lost and all of that, but then, after a while then she got use to it. But, er her…experience of falling down in the snow and having a cracked spine, erm, so things like that are there. But yeah, I mean she was fine she…was great I mean, they just, you know, parents decided yes we have to make ends meet and move on. We just cannot complain about it.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>. <em>Did you find anything culturally difficult, when you came as a teenager? You see the other young, English teenagers, same age as you?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, because er… culturally they’re different. We were very, sort of, er…family orientated. We were all as I told you, there was no such thing as ‘oh right, now you’re sixteen get out of the house’ kind of attitude, we just lived with them. So yes, there were a lot of culture shocks, there was a lot of learning to be done.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And also, vice versa they needed to learn but they were all like… we know it all kind of thing, ok fine you know it all.</p>
<p><em>Going back to Uganda when you were talking about your experience in school…</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What kind of things did you do out of school, when you wasn’t at school, or, perhaps helping your dad?</em></p>
<p>Here?</p>
<p><em>In Uganda…</em></p>
<p>In Uganda well basically you went, you went to school you came back, because you had a shop and that was just common, with all, because we were in a small place.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So it was common, that you go and stand in the shop, and you…</p>
<p><em>You help out.</em></p>
<p>XXXX that, and then you waited til close to have dinner together. Erm…but then you met few of the kids, there was no fear as such, I mean, pre-problems. You were roaming around free, there was no problem about somebody, or…you know having parents to drop you at school and pick up at school because of you know, snatchings and all these kind of things in this country now. But no, you didn’t have to worry at all, you just went and did what you had to do.</p>
<p>[TELEPHONE RINGS]</p>
<p><em>When you was talking about that incident, in the beginning about, being , being in that house and hearing the gunshots, em…did you, your parents left, decided to go the next day but before that. As soon as he did an announcement, what was the, the days like before? Before that experience? </em></p>
<p>We somehow believed that he can’t be serious…that Idi Amin doesn’t mean it and he’ll change the decision. But it, wasn’t to be.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So that was the first thing when you heard this thing, that maybe he’ll change and then the colours started to come out and then no no… this is not the place now.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>Across the community there was a belief…</em></p>
<p>Yeah absolutely.</p>
<p><em>…that he’d change his mind?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>And, do you, do you still remember any of the other families that came with you? Cos you got a plane straight, did you get a plane straight from Kampala to… to Britain? </em></p>
<p>Yeah, no… they, the airport is at a place called Entebbe</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>So you had to drive erm buses to… you know, to take us there so you went from Kampala to Entebbe and then boarded the aircraft.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember the first day at Greenham?</em></p>
<p>Yes, the first day that we were taken, I mean we were very tired because we came and tried to find the luggage. Trying to find XXXX you know, nothing came. So you just hopped on the bus, and you didn’t know where you were going and you were tired. And er….what do you do, you just rest and, when you got there then suddenly it dawns on you that, my god, this is different.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>I have to make it, happen.</p>
<p><em>How long did you stay in the camp?</em></p>
<p>We were there for about… fifteen days.</p>
<p><em>OK. And then, then you relocated to er…</em></p>
<p>Relocated to London, and from London to…to Luton. XXXX into my uncle’s place in Finchley…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…and from there my dad found a job in Luton, then…he found a place to live XXXX.</p>
<p><em>Was you, was it your uncles house or was it er…</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><em>…with his family, aswell?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>[TELEPHONE RINGS].</p>
<p><em>So shortly afterwards and then you, your dad got XXXX.</em></p>
<p>Yeah once he got a job, got a place to live XXXX.</p>
<p><em>So, after you finished your job in Tesco, you started to work in Natwest. </em></p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Yeah, finished Tesco come back to Natwest then the Bureau de Change so it was like three jobs a day. So you were doing a cycle.</p>
<p><em>Where you working seven days a week?</em></p>
<p>Er…almost, yes. Almost. Because initially there was no Sundays.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>So you didn’t XXXX…</p>
<p><em>So half day only?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, so then, well it became longer then we worked longer.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>Have you ever been back to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>I’ve been to Uganda yes, I’ve been back to Uganda…I think its thriving, there’s a lot of opportunities now with oil they found as well…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…in Uganda, so yes there are opportunities. But with the opportunities and having lived here I would like to see that hopefully, that this oil doesn’t make people…er…become egoist.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>I hope they’ve learned from the lessons of Nigeria, I hope the le…the lessons that are happening in other countries. And, try and use that oil wealth to better the life of, common. It is the common, and how do we get to the common and how do we make sure, I think that’s for the governments to decide. But, if they ignore the common and they just become one big party, then it is going to be a problem.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. When, what year did you first go back to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Eight-y….eighty-six, eighty eighty eight.</p>
<p><em>Eighty eight.</em></p>
<p>Nineteen eighty eight.</p>
<p><em>Did you go alone or did you go with your family?</em></p>
<p>No no no my family hasn’t been. I went alone for work.</p>
<p><em>And after that you just went back regularly or…years?</em></p>
<p>Yeah I went back because I was in Banking so there were customers there, so I went to Uganda, Kenya Tanzania, South Africa.</p>
<p><em>Do you ever go back to your home town?</em></p>
<p>Not been able to go my sister went to see it…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Er…last, no, two years back. She went. She went to see it, she wanted to see what was happening but…</p>
<p><em>What did she say?</em></p>
<p>No, she, she obviously, she was very young she couldn’t remember but um…yeah, when it came to the house she remembered the house. She remembered how the house looked…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And um, what it looks like now. So XXXX.</p>
<p><em>It’s still there?</em></p>
<p>It’s still there, but its er…completely run down.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Have you got any visits planned soon?</em></p>
<p>I would like to go next year, er definitely to Uganda. To see what can be done.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Erm….I’d like to make it a win-win situation for Uganda as well, so let’s see, whether you’ll…</p>
<p><em>So you go back, and work, and, and kind of invest?</em></p>
<p>Yes, we looking to…before that I was in private banking. So you’ll looking at wealthy to give money to the black XXXX and others to invest. So that was one side of it. Em...but as I said, do I go for holiday, no and when I went there I asked, enquired to go back to the birthplace and they said ‘no, it’s not worth it’.</p>
<p><em>Who said ‘it’s not worth it’?</em></p>
<p>My uncle…</p>
<p><em>Your uncle…</em></p>
<p>Who is there in Uganda, so he said don’t take chances. Because there's still, er…when Idi Amin overthrew Obote, then Obote came back again…so you see there is resistance…between those two. And that resistance is still not resolved. So they still, want to fight.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Do, do you remember em…the way in which the Ugandan Asian and the black Ugandan there, how they got along?</em></p>
<p>The Asians and Ugandans?</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>I think predominantly, I think if you look majority of the, the Africans that were working for you.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>They had highest regards.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>They had no, no issue and they didn’t want to let us go.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Because they knew what would happen to the economy. Suppose you would left the key in the shop and it’s fully loaded, it’s got material, everything there.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>But if they guy…whoever finds the shop, open, because we just left</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And unless he has some substance in him to change and redecorate the place and things like that, there’s nothing going to happen.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Did your father lose everything he had in Uganda at the point?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Because I hear that XXXX, yeah…</em></p>
<p>Because we left. We just left, the shop open.</p>
<p><em>Did he, did he ever have plans to go back to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>He wanted to go back to Uganda just to see.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But it didn’t happen. It didn’t happen. Er…because what has happened is two folded. Once you’re not feeling so good and that, and then you want to go then you think ‘OK, it’s a third world country, if I go there, I fall sick then what will happen?’ that’s number one. Secondly, ‘even if I go back, at the moment he had fond memories of the house, because it was his house, visualise, said wow this is the house we lived.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But now, after so many years, and whatever now you’ve got the people from Congo, there…who are willing to take up and rent.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>So then you start wondering, you know...</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>What, how, how would you want the, you know, because it’s the fortieth anniversary, this year.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>How do you, how do you think it should be celebrated?</em></p>
<p>What do we do, OK. We as you saw the… Parliament, that did it. We had er…multi faith service…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…which has been planned. What, we, as a committee one of the things that we were looking, is to try and do an event where we can get the first generation that actually came here.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>What happened is that every community got scattered. People went to different places. So, suppose we picked a town in Uganda and said all the people that lived, cos that was small places. Uganda was very tiny as a country anyway. So you had, er, different towns, so we’d start XXXX suppose we had picked a town and then, people from…all people from that town, it will be so good see how they use to know each other and then suddenly they’ve lost contact. It’ll be good for second, third generation also to understand, because the third generation do not like to be called British Asians, XXXX sorry, er, Ugandan Asian, they like to be called British Asians.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>They don’t want anything to do with it, because….</p>
<p><em>Is that something you’ve witnessed, er you know, amongst your family and…</em></p>
<p>Yes yes yes, even, even my kids OK they want to go, but will they call themselves no, they don’t. Are you Indian? Says ‘yeah’ but Indians because of you and because of granddad and all of that. We are OK, but Ugandan? No. Because we, er… educated there, or… did businesses there, we were born there, so we still feel connected to that motherland…</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>…in that way. That yes, there is and that’s why I, I still try and do some charity work in Uganda and things like that, ya, for sure.</p>
<p><em>So, you still, you see yourself as Ugandan Asian.</em></p>
<p>I do, I do because I believe that, you know, my thing is in a different way. That ok, we were fortunate that British took us.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>But there were a lot of Ugandans, who were, who were died, xxx because Idi Amin went for them as well because they were trying to protect the Asians.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>So, what happened to them? What happened to their family? We were fortunate, that somebody took care us. What about that? So…the idea is to think because once we do fundraising whatever money comes in, what can we do for those Ugandan Ugandans…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Who were left behind. And who lost…their, dear ones or whatever. What can we do to help them? That’s one for the things, that is on mind as well. That we need to do. there was a point in time when we were thinking that we should have an archive of…experiences, of er… things that we could learn from Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>And, leave it as an archive so that somebody, whoever wants to look at a reference it’s there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>But…let’s see. I mean it all depends on money.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>How much we raise, and we what we can do. We wanted to do a musical programme again, one was trying to bring, do something in one of the parks.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>So that can everybody can come on a summer day and er…</p>
<p><em>A big event?</em></p>
<p>…yeah, meet people, that’s one of them. The second one was er…cultural event in Royal Albert Hall or wherever.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Er, for that matter of musical evening…er…and try and keep the ticket as minimum as possible so that everybody can participate and come.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And we were hoping to, now hoping to do one in London and one in Leicester. So that people up north can, come and join the Leicester event. And of course, the, most welcome to join both.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>..but that’s the way we see it.</p>
<p><em>Is this part of the parliamentary group?</em></p>
<p>The XXXX forty no, this is the…the…fortieth anniversary Uganda, group.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>Its specifically for this celebrations, what do we do, how do we go about it.</p>
<p><em>So, how how would you, how would you, what else do you think that, not what you can do, but as kind of…more reflective perhaps of, British society, how do you think the…the experience of Ugandan Asian should be remembered? So you can talk about activities, but also, you know…the, the experience of coming as refugees, being expelled by Idi Amin, and… er now you’ve been here for forty years, you know. Stories are slowly coming out now, you know, through projects that commemorating…</em></p>
<p>Ya, absolutely. Em…</p>
<p>[AMBULANCE SIRENS]</p>
<p>We…tried and see…er…because a lot of the first generation now are very elderly.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>I mean if we XXXX assuming we are forty years in this country now, then when some of those of guys came when they were forty.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And, some of those guys came when they were thirty. So…you know, lot of time has gone by like my father…you know, he’s seventy six XXXX. So what do you do? So a lot of those have either passed away, some of them</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>Some of them are very elderly, probably got ailments, er…so all of this so we felt that OK, let’s bring, try and make it so that it’s not full of speeches and XXXX big dinners..</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>But let them come and mingle and talk. Let it be a time to reconcile, or…try to XXXX.</p>
<p><em>XXXX.</em></p>
<p>Now that’s the way we do it. There was also talk of trying to do something at Stansted airport, because that’s where majority of the flights came. But em…again, er, alright that’ll be nice but then, only…er, it will make some effect to you if you were from Uganda and you landed, then you look at it. Um…is it money well spent? Or is better to do something for people that actually suffered, because …now also some of the Ugandan, I mean it’s not all good stories. There are certain people who felt that ‘no no no I would wish I was never here because the kids grew up, and they got married, then their attitudes changed, westernisation came into their life’ er, the…looking after parents was natural in Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>It’s not so natural now.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Of course according to our customs yes but…</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS] </em></p>
<p>You see what I’m saying?</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So, that kind of tails, from the, first generation is there. That ‘no no no no no this country’ initially when they came it was good.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>Because the kids were young and they were listening.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Er… so things have changed… in, in that way so what are they… you know, would they want to go back…and course their not because they…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…elderly, and they probably have…hospital requirements and all sorts of things, so no, they wouldn’t want to go back to Uganda as such. But, they do remember in Uganda ‘look how it was, I looked after my parents, I looked after my uncles, we as uncles, six brothers living together in one house and…now...’</p>
<p><em>The golden times…kind of?</em></p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>So, things have moved on, so yes…there are, that kind of stories that are there as well.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, and even you were kind of se- second generation when you came here, you know, your children…</em></p>
<p>Ah, they will be very different in their mindset.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>Their…</p>
<p><em>Do they understand your experiences, do you talk to them about…</em></p>
<p>Yeah we’ve talked, we talked about it, they’ve seen the documentaries and everything…but em, again, as I said…the…the experience, and this is being philosophical, each experience of each individual is different.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And, it’s very difficult…sometimes to, put in words that experience only you can feel that yourself.</p>
<p><em>Of course.</em></p>
<p>…and and er…and that’s what it is, and, as I said in my case, I have, really tried to integrate with community, by getting involved in…a lot of charities here in this country, which benefits this country. Of course, also the other way round helping country, you know some overseas India, Uganda, things like that. Erm…and also trying to do, as much as possible, to…to make life, better, not just for myself, but also for others. As a way of giving.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>And hence I do mentoring, I do, you know, trustee of many charities and…guide the charities because you are a road, bridge builder, so you build the bridge for people to communicate to try and see how the charities can work together. And ideas to inspire.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And move on you see.</p>
<p><em>Is that, is that philosophy something you, you, you got when you came, when you arrived here, or something that perhaps your father might of… XXXX.</em></p>
<p>It is, something that I think…again, er, what I believe is that…in my case, I just looked at it that ‘OK’, my father wasn’t educated, so for me, I had to…make the move myself. I had to take the chances, and, and that, because…to my father, ‘oh working in a bank so you must be a life time job, you don’t have to worry about changing your job’.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about changing your job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>That kind of attitude, banks are safe kind of thing.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Em…but having in that, you know, that you can get hired and fired.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…as things evolved and changed, in this current society. So you had that.</p>
<p><em>Because of that experience with Idi Amin?</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>…to keep it moving?</em></p>
<p>I had to keep moving, and … I send my brother off to, to US because there was that fear that OK, if ever something, because my father was ‘oh, something could happen in this country, we may be thrown out then where will we go?’</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Where do we go? So he said ‘no. One of us, must, live away from UK.’ And we sent him to United States in 1984… as soon as he got…</p>
<p><em>Is this your youngest brother?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>How old was he then, when he, when you sent him off?</em></p>
<p>Er…when he went to US, he… was eighteen. He finished his A-Levels and said he didn’t want to study any further.</p>
<p><em>Mm-hmm.</em></p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>But, just because of that, they way XXXX.</p>
<p>It was the mindset yes, that you know, it could happen.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. And he was happy to go?</em></p>
<p>He wasn’t happy to go but we had to….</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p><em>He’s the youngest…</em></p>
<p>Yes… and for mum it was a shock.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So but, we had to…er…reason with him, and…just do it. Not XXXX believed in nothing, but then there’s no such thing as never, because you don’t know.</p>
<p><em>Mm.</em></p>
<p>You truly don’t know what’s going to come. And I believe that this society is very tolerant, and they’ve accepted people gracefully then, I think it should continue. But er… time will tell.</p>
<p><em>OK, thank you. </em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><em>I’ll just stop that now. </em></p>
