Ok then. You touched on something I think is really important, I think this’ll probably be important to you as well. You were talking about your own identity, and…you know, sort of, the idea of, living in Britain and obviously achieving…em…a new life for yourself in Britain. Em…what about the cultural heritage of your children? I mean… I know you’re sort of, perhaps, a little bit unique cos…obviously I don’t know your other siblings but having met your daughter she’s gone back to Uganda and actually done that, documentary. Em…but, in terms of the second generation, and perhaps not even your siblings, do you think there is awareness of cultural heritage amongst the second generation of Ugandan Asian in Britain?</em></h3>
<p>Er... [LONG PAUSE]. Yes but fading. So, em…my er, if you take me personally, my feelings towards er, Uganda or er… cultural heritage arising from India er…are…stronger, than my children’s would be.</p>
<p><em>Mhm</em></p>
<p>But mine are not as strong as my parents were.</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>So this is…to me, this is something that you will naturally ex, expect, is going to happen whether were….and…there isn’t much that you can do to change. Er…and…no matter how hard one tries, things. the e only thing that is certain is change. Em…and...is there any good or bad? It’s also always from personal perspective.</p>
<p><em>Mhm</em></p>
<p>Whether something that is changing is good or not. Em….so you can’t control the XXXX … the change. You do your, what you think is best for your, your children. Em… and I think that applies to every human being probably, and xxxx to every, er, part of the society that we live in today. So em, will my children’s association, or heritage be as strong as mine was towards er, Uganda particularly…em…er the answer is no. it would not be. But is that a bad thing or a good thing? My view is, that its irrelevant, it is the…society that you live in, society from which you take er…you…must be prepared to give, so long as you do that, then you’ve delivered a good human being.</p>
<p><em>Mhm</em></p>
<p>That’s that’s really...</p>
<p><em>A well XXXX.</em></p>
<p>XXXX. now, it is always very easy to find few instances to say all the society’s unfair an d they could have done this, and look at this, they have er…they’ve done such and such thing to a particular section of the society. Em…that’s very easy, but on the whole, to live in England, to live amongst the people that we’ve lived amongst. To be able to be given the opportunity er…to grasp, our children where…treated equally. Em…and….the proof of the pudding is in the fact that er, they have done and achieved what they have.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>Em….</p>
<p><em>Do you think em…do you think it’s important they know sort of, the turmoil of the expulsion, the story. I mean not necessarily have links to Uganda or even links their Indian heritage. But do you think it’s important to be aware of, what…em, you and your generation, your parents generation went through in nineteen seventy two. </em></p>
<p>Er…I personally don’t, but I think there are people in the community that do. I don’t only because I think that er, the people who think it’s important that they remember all that are the ones who XXXX the society not to change. Er, and…I give er…I…I have fairly good knowledge of Jewish society XXXX for example and if, even if you look at scriptures…er when you look at Jewish scriptures they were referred to holocaust. And they want that to er, be a reminder to their children time and again, because they think that if they do that, then their society will not change.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>Er…I don’t necessarily believe that’s how things should be. But there are people who believe that they should remember the turmoil, they should remember the way we use to live or the way people use to live in Africa. Er…and to enjoy that er, almost in XXXX privileged position, they should remember all of that er…</p>
<p><em>Do you think they’re the people who perhaps been less successful in England?</em></p>
<p>Erm…no, not necessarily. I mean they would be very successful people who might think like that. Ya, I, no I don’t think, I don’t think so. I think this success overall, if you were to take that at twenty eight, thirty thousand people who arrived in…the country. Er, from Uganda, and…how they have, assimilated within the society and how they’ve er, progressed if…financial wellbeing is progress. Er…if you see that then, very large part has been quite successful.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Successful in different er…variety. We arrived really, those Ugandan Asians who arrived here, arrived at a time, in a nation which was a nation of small shopkeepers. Er…and...before Asians it might have been Jewish community…</p>
<p><em>Yeah, yeah</em></p>
<p>… or it might have been or whichever community er em…and…and the very fact that XXXX…to a large part of that arrival of Asians, English wasn’t necessarily…er, they were not fluent in…in terms of communications. And therefore it meant that when they went to the job centres for a job they’d end up taking a menial job.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And…and when you have, you take for example somebody like my father…who ran in his own business, but wasn’t very…fluent in English. Er, so…he would have, he struggled to get a job. So what he was prepared to take any job and he took a night shift, er job in a bakery. Er, in Chatham. Now…er…the point I’m trying to make really is that if you’re prepared to work, you will be able to progress. And from him working in that, in that bakery to…us where we are today. There is a direct link.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>And that is the work ethic of the people.</p>
<p><em>Now…it leads perfectly onto pretty much my last but one question. And em…XXXX, I mean you are held in very high regards as I mentioned earlier in terms of…the, the, probably the standout migrant group that arrived. Because of the way you arrived as refugees aswell. Em…and such a success story, I mean celebrated on many levels, through media, em…through politics, em…quite often if you’re pro-government, to dispel the idea of bringing more immigrants into the country and support migrants and you would use the Ugandan Asians as a perfect example, of how, what can be achieved as a migrant. And also how successful migrants can assimilate. And not only adapt to English culture but also add, something to English culture. Now…XXXX, why do you think that was successful, I mean you’ve mentioned that, em, I’ve heard different answers. One that was a merchant class anyway, and you brought that certain entrepreneurial skill and…that sort of, entrepreneurial ambition, and that merchant ability. Em…other aspects I've heard is because there was a already a network of Gujarati Asians in Britain anyway. I mean there’s no one answer but can you give me sort of XXXX…</em></p>
<p>My…perspective on that is very simple. This is, and this is it. [Short pause]. The community that arrived, there was a fair proportion of…that community who where in businesses and understand, wheeling, and understood wheeling and dealing. Em…buying and selling, er…identifying opportunities of the products that were required in a particular er…particular place. Em…so that is one aspect. The second aspect which is probably more important that the first er…first aspect was that, er, not being…high, not being educated, er…and not being very fluent in communications. Er…that…that particular generation, would struggled with getting, er…what one might call, decent professional jobs. Er, so when it came to…er, work. The work was available but it was, of er…of menial work i.e. bus conductors, train drivers, er…car park attendants er…cleaners…er, XXXX see people in Harrow of that, not necessarily from, not, at Heathrow, not necessarily of er, of Ugandan descent but er, people from Indian origin.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Em. So those jobs were available and…er, if you were a businessman, you held a certain status in…the society in Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>To come then, to come then and…work as a manual worker somewhere…XXXX.</p>
<p><em>The bottom man, did not sit very well with, with the community so, there’s sought out opportunities. So I mean, would you rather ironically the privileged status you had back in Uganda which possible caused the populism that led to your leaving…then drove you to achieve your success …</em></p>
<p>In…England. I…I don’t think that er, that er, that er…the, the reason for the Ugandans being thrown out was the fact that they were successful in Uganda. I think the reason was, ah, Idi Amin wanted to get back at the British government…</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em>.</p>
<p>…who had turned down some aid. I can’t remember exactly what it was.</p>
<p><em>Well I don’t think the British would have took him seriously to be honest. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>XXXX. [LAUGHS]. Em, I‘d heard that you can tell me this aswell, this is anecdotal and this will be before we wrap up. Somebody told me…he fell in love with a Ugandan Asian.</em></p>
<p>He did. He xxxx….</p>
<p><em>She rejected him.</em></p>
<p>Yes. He, he wanted to, to marry er…the…</p>
<p>Prominent businessman XXXX.</p>
<p>Prominent business, business er…woman. Em…called Madrawnis, and…he had actually suggested that and…when he was turned down, that could have been part of.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>But this is, lot of, there are a lot innuendos here.</p>
<p><em>And also you’re trying to rationalise a very random man [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Yes, correct, correct.</p>
<p><em>Em, how do you think em…the anniversary should be celebrated? We spoken about you know, you…don’t, you’ve articulated the idea that it’s not necessarily that important that second third generation, you know, like hold, close ties to Uganda, and the process of expulsion. But how do you think. I mean obviously I, the reason I’m interviewing you is because it’s been forty years.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Em…I mean how should this be celebrated? I mean, do you think, people in Britain know the story and I don’t mean Ugandan Asian or people XXXX, I mean why’s it English people do you think…they need to be aware of the, your story and…your process or?</em></p>
<p>Do I think?</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>That’s a difficult one for me to answer…</p>
<p><em>You’ll have to speak up.</em></p>
<p>…on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p><em>[LAUGHS]. XXXX.</em></p>
<p>XXXX if I speak on my behalf would I like, divide a society to know how we have fared, and how this society, the British, the English society helped us to get to…to the level that we have got to. Em…and almost without exception, everybody has down well, compared to what they were doing when they were in Uganda. Would I like the British er, would I like the society, the world at large to, to be aware of that…than yes. Personally I feel it would be a good idea, er for the soc-, for the…general, English, British, society to know, how, the English society works and appreciates, and… assists, in difficult times. Er…I have nothing but sense of gratitude for that.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Er, I think we as er, if there's one thing I would say that is er that, we as, as Asians we should really give back to the society. Not moan and groan and…whether it’s to do with taxes, whether it’s to do with charity XXXX, whether it’s to, assist with local projects. We should give because we have been given a heck of a lot, and we could have easily fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>That’s how I feel.</p>
<p><em>And what an amazing way to celebrate it actually. </em></p>
<p>Ya.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Em…celebrating the two cultures coming together and the two societies, actually, easing each other and helping each other and allowing British society to move forward and advanced together. </em></p>
<p>Where else can you go in the world, er, I suspect nowhere, where there is a positive discrimination …</p>
<p><em>Mhm. [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>To help you to arise, so that you are at the same standard as your neighbour.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. </em></p>
<p>So…</p>
<p><em>I think the one place in the world that would protagonise, that would be the US where I lived there for five years and I’m not sure whether XXXX…</em></p>
<p>I’m not sure, I, I have friends who are, who live in US, I have been to US many a times.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>Em…I’m not sure, that if you actually cut through the strand of the society across the broader in U.S and I’m talking about the Puerto Ricans or the…er…Latino descent…</p>
<p><em>The Hispanic communities XXXX.</em></p>
<p>XXXXX ya.</p>
<p><em>I mean I, you know, people always, I think, it’s really distasteful that people use the example of having a black president is if, race relations have now got an equal footing. I mean I personally think without being offensive that, I’m probably as black, African American as President Obama.</em></p>
<p>Ya.</p>
<p><em>He’s educated in a white XXXX, born in Hawaii [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>Yeah. All his, all his…</p>
<p><em>I don’t know if he hung around on the block XXXX with the XXXX [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>No, he’s very er…what would be XXXX, of any other, white XXXX…</p>
<p><em>Educated middle class.</em></p>
<p>…and but, if you, if you were to take the poor class er…whites in states.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p><em>Er…I’m not sure that they would er, be anywhere near, the likes of Obama.</em></p>
<p>XXXX, it’s true.</p>
<p><em>Or George bush even. [LAUGHS]. Right the last question Mr Samani, and I promise it is, em…I do this and it’s a bit of always a jovial sort of end, I mean… I've spoken to a couple of members of your community and, their joke was that we actually have a picture of Idi Amin in our kitchen. Em to thank him, and commemorate him for what he did. Em, I know that’s sort of like…it’s perhaps turning someone who, who proves to be a very brutal horrible dictator, but there kinda almost laughing at him and that’s what we do don’t we. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>I mean we laugh at Hitler as a British culture we turn him into a, you know, an object of…sort of, mickey-taking. Em… jokiness and I think it’s the same what they did with Idi Amin. What would your message be to Idi Amin now? I know he’s departed to wherever he’s departed to, em…XXXX</em></p>
<p>I…if I had to give message to Idi Amin…</p>
<p><em>If he’s sitting now in front of me.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I would say to him…that er, although his intentions were vile, when he did what he did. Em…it, happens that it has actually benefited em, my community tremendously. And I would actually thank him for, having done what he did but I would be thanking him now, not necessarily nineteen seventy two.</p>
<p><em>Of course, of course. And I think as a legacy, em…I think we all celebrate sort of, the achievement of your community, as we should. But I think also, people should be aware of, what damage it caused Uganda when you left, XXXX.</em></p>
<p>No the sorry part is, is that er…the people who suffered are the native Africans.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>And they suffered to a, a significant degree…there have been deaths, er, financially there are no better off.</p>
<p><em>Mhm.</em></p>
<p>There may be a very small section that is, but there is nothing to say that section would have done well in any case.</p>
<p><em>Of course. </em></p>
<p>Em…and I, I XXXX, I returned to Uganda for the first time after forty years in…September of two thousand and ten.</p>
<p><em>Oh is it that late?</em></p>
<p>That late…I had never gone back I had gone to Kenya a few times on holiday but never to Uganda. Er, and…putting it bluntly I don’t think that a lot of that African has improved, that significantly. There are, there are very successful African businessman as there should be and that, and…</p>
<p><em>You hope they would be after forty years.</em></p>
<p>But on the whole, in terms of the populist, er…are they any better off? I think, you would probably get a resounding answer saying that they’re not.</p>
<p><em>Mhm. And what was your, we’ll close on this now, but what was your feeling when it set off, off that plane, what were your expectations in fact? Cos XXXX…</em></p>
<p>When I, when I left I went on my holidays?</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I don’t mean that for forty years XXXX.</em></p>
<p>I hadn’t been there for forty years, my expectations were, em…that, that er, things will have changed significantly but they only changed significantly in…the, in …the towns, cities, but er, otherwise the rule of communities is still the same. There’s deterioration in terms of wellbeing of the buildings, and the arch-, and the civil services, and the roads. That, has er, any growth that has been there has been very half-hazard.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Sporadic. </em></p>
<p>Er, and I… I visited the home that I grew up in. where there was an African family living, and they were very welcoming and they, allowed me to look at the room I use sleep in…</p>
<p><em>I thought you were going to say they thought you were gonna come back and ask for the keys [LAUGHS].</em></p>
<p>No, no, even if they thought so, they knew, XXXX. But on the whole, the African…for, whose name this, this expulsion took place, I don’t think has benefited XXXX.</p>
<p><em>However I think it’s benefited a large number of your community.</em></p>
<p>Oh without any doubt.</p>
<p><em>But I think you’ve also benefited yourself, through what is, hard work and XXXX, I think that’s also. </em></p>
<p>I think that, that goes without saying, its…one should be grateful for having the opportunity to be able to work hard and to, to…</p>
<p><em>Achieve. And I think I can’t think of a better note to finish the interview er, Mr Samani.</em></p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p><em>Thank you very much.</em></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><em>Really really appreciate this.</em></p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p><em>And, em, thank you for giving me your time.</em></p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p><em>Right.</em></p>
