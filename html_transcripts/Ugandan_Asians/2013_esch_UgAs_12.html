<p><em>OK so this is Lwam Tesfay interviewing, Mina…</em></p>
<p>Bhatt.</p>
<p><em>Bhatt, erm on… the twenty third of February two thousand and thirteen. If I can start off by telling me your, the spelling of your full name and date of birth?</em></p>
<p>Minaxi, M-I-N-A-X-I, Bhatt, B-H-A-T-T. Thirteen, four, fifty four.</p>
<p><em>And where were you born?</em></p>
<p>I was born in Lugazi, Uganda.</p>
<p><em>OK and how long have you lived in the UK?</em></p>
<p>Since seventy two, forty years.</p>
<p><em>What was your life like growing up in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>It was nice [LAUGHS]…free. Being a child we didn’t have any worries. I’d come, I grew up with a sort of, like a family business, of MEHTA group. So we all worked as one big family instead of working for my dad basically.</p>
<p><em>What did your dad do?</em></p>
<p>He was a supervisor in a sugar factory.</p>
<p><em>Did you help out aswell XXXX?</em></p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><em>But that’s what your family did, so your other relatives?</em></p>
<p>Well, no. We, it wasn’t our own business. We worked for, MEHTA group. XXXX owner of the sugar factory. But my dad was about fourteen when he actually came to Africa, Lugazi and he…more or less built Lugazi with MEHTA group, as part of MEHTA family.</p>
<p><em>And your mum?</em></p>
<p>She never worked, but she was a housewife in Africa.</p>
<p><em>Did you come from a large family?</em></p>
<p>Er…three brothers, three sisters.</p>
<p><em>So, where are you positioned?</em></p>
<p>Em…in the middle.</p>
<p><em>In the middle. What was school like in Uganda, did you go to like a…er, a British Indian school or…?</em></p>
<p>It was English medium, it’s called but it was all, basically owned by METHA anyway. So it was er, em… a good school, good education up to like, GCSE level here.</p>
<p><em>What was the area like where you grew up? Was there a lot of other Asian families there, or…?</em></p>
<p>It was mainly Asian and African, but Asian. It was a big, like I said a big large family living in individual houses.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p><em>What about after school, did you use to do things with your friends, or…? Like, I hear stories of people climbing mango trees and…</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah, we use to go out every day. We had friends living next to each other, like, education wise we use share each other’s books you know. It was a, like a, friendly environment.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Er…fear free environment it was.</p>
<p><em>What about celebrating, like religious festivals, did you, did the community celebrate…?</em></p>
<p>We use to celebrate all together like er…Diwali, Eid, em, Sikh and you know, festivals for XXXX. We use to celebrate as one…thing. Everybody knew each, everybody. Like even the weddings, if there was a wedding in one family, everyone went to help type of thing. So it was one large family doing everything for everybody.</p>
<p><em>So no divisions?</em></p>
<p>There was no division, there was no culture barrier, there was no…who’s who. Whether they’re rich or poor, they were all one.</p>
<p><em>What about the relationship with the…black Ugandans, black African Ugandans? </em></p>
<p>When I went to school there were few, only very few Africans. Like three I can remember.</p>
<p><em>In your class?</em></p>
<p>In my class, but majority was, other labourers who never sent their kids to school.</p>
<p><em>Because they can’t afford it or…?</em></p>
<p>Probably they can’t afford it, basically. But the schools were free, only the minimum school fees, the teaching was up to… you had to pay a hundred shillings I can remember…a year or month or something like that.</p>
<p><em>To go to the higher schools?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>So how old were you when Idi Amin made the announcement?</em></p>
<p>Oh I think I was about twenty, at the time. Yeah. Must be twenty.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember that day when they made that declaration, did you…?</em></p>
<p>I wasn’t, I actually, I…that day, just before that, I went to India for my further education, so when I landed in Bombay the declaration was made so…</p>
<p><em>How did you feel?</em></p>
<p>Scared. You didn’t know what was happening, and you know we XXXX family. My mum, my brothers.</p>
<p><em>They were all still in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Yeah there were all still in Uganda, my dad. So we were scared what was going to happen, to the rest of the family or XXXX, because we…didn’t know what to do. So…but em, my mum, my elder brother came here first. And then my mum, my younger brother and sister followed. My dad, because he was a supervisor, they wouldn’t let him go so he left in the middle of the night. And then, and he joined the family about six months later, and then, we were called over there. We were called back here.</p>
<p><em>So, so whilst you were in Bombay, your family came to the UK and then you followed afterwards?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What was it like when you first came, to UK?</em></p>
<p>I…my family was living, still living in the countryside, Huntingdon; I came to Neasd…em, XXXX Hill. That’s where my cousin…my Uncle layed…lived.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So he came to pick me up from the airport, my brother came from Huntingdon to pick me up and take me there. It was strange, even the English you spoke was a different dialect. People, was hard to understand the English and…but…once I went to Huntingdon I went to job centre on Monday. And…next day I got a job. And this is the way I learned my English. And then I did my secretary at college, XXXX.</p>
<p><em>What was your first job?</em></p>
<p>First job was in Tesco’s. Er…</p>
<p><em>Which one?</em></p>
<p>XXXX, ah well in Huntingdon. At that time Tesco’s wasn’t very big.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>Sorry I just…</p>
<p>[INTERVIEWEE SPEAKS TO FRIEND]</p>
<p><em>No problem.</em></p>
<p><em>Don’t worry. Em…so first job in…Tesco? </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What were you doing, what were you doing like er…?</em></p>
<p>Yeah….erm, shelf filling stuff like that.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember the first day at work?</em></p>
<p>Yeah yeah yeah, but you know I was very lucky because I was in the countryside people were very very helpful.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>And then I had started working, em…my school holid….you know once I started my secretary at college I started working for em… firm. Which use to help me out with clerical, kind of jobs. And…then afterwards, I went to work for M-O-D.</p>
<p><em>What would er…we’ll, can I talk to you a little bit about that, but the…the people in Huntingdon, what were they like? Cos I’m sure at that time, a lot of other Ugandan Asians and Asians…</em></p>
<p>Not in that area…</p>
<p><em>No in that area?</em></p>
<p>Ya, there were only about…one, two, three families there. and there were absolutely friendly. Absolutely friendly. They went out of their ways to help.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember any specific neighbours, or people that were really helpful?</em></p>
<p>Yeah yeah, my next door neighbours she was very, very, very…her name was Anne, she was very, very helpful. She got me this, as I said job, part-time job. And …always, they were help…helping us out. You know like, because we didn’t have a car or…you know, take us to the shop and XXXX, showing us where we could get stuff and…like er, helping us out with, where to get the help…from, or where you need to go for doctors, stuff like that, which generally you need.</p>
<p><em>And if someone, you know, is helping you, in the very beginning stages it’s a big help. Something small to them, but…</em></p>
<p>Yeah yeah. We always like, even now, my brothers and that still in touch with them…today, because they’ve been good neighbours and they’re still there.</p>
<p><em>So your job at the ministry of defence, how, how long did you work there for?</em></p>
<p>Until I got married, so quite a long time…</p>
<p><em>What were you doing?</em></p>
<p>I was secretary.</p>
<p><em>How did you get the job?</em></p>
<p>Em, I just applied, through er, through job centre.</p>
<p><em>Was that in the city?</em></p>
<p>No, no in Huntingdon.</p>
<p><em>Huntingdon. And what was that like working there? Because you went from Tesco to, Ministry of Defence, it’s a bit of a change? </em></p>
<p>Yes, it was big change but then I did my secretary at college. So I, I qualified as a secretary.</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>So I needed somewhere where I could use my…er skills. So I went and worked for… I got a job, it took them long because I had to get my…em, status cleared. Like I wasn’t a criminal…</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>And all that, my parent’s status…and especially, I came from Uganda so there…was nobody there that could vouch for me. Basically. They found a teacher who use to teach me, and they vouched for me kinda thing.</p>
<p><em>As like a reference…?</em></p>
<p>Reference, that I wasn’t lying. I was actually in Uganda, Lugazi as they call it. Because for them, even though they knew, they wouldn’t get much response from the country. We knew that somebody if they got it, would be a jackpot kind of thing.</p>
<p><em>Were you still thinking about Uganda, more or less, as soon as you left…or? Did you want to go back home?</em></p>
<p>I…want to go back yes, just to see what it is, my birth place basically. Where I was born, you know, how it is, and how does it look. Stuff like that, but I don’t have any more attachment now, probably because I was a child, when I came here. Most of my life I’ve been here so I don’t have that attachment. Plus, my, I don’t have my family there. If I had my family there it would be a different thing. I don’t have anybody, I want to Uganda I think…</p>
<p><em>Are most of them here?</em></p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p><em>All of them?</em></p>
<p>So…you don’t have that attachment. We don’t have, we didn’t own any properties as such because, we use to work for MEHTA group so they gave us, houses and all that. None of us have anything we want to go back to claim or anything, we have…because we are now settled here as you see, we don’t wanna go. I just want to go, just to see where I was born, but em, I want to take my kids just to show them where I was born. But not…that…that…attachment. I feel I’m Ugandan. I am Ugandan, and I come…you know, I…</p>
<p><em>You’re proud to be Ugandan…</em></p>
<p>Ugandan. But em…we even had once, er…organisation, you know…Lugazi get together.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. So you were saying you didn’t have any property there so you don’t really feel attached?</em></p>
<p>It’s not…I wouldn’t say a, property as such but I don’t have family. If I had family there then I would definitely go back. Like say if I had my parents still there, or my brothers…or my sisters…or somebody I would go back. But because none of them there.</p>
<p><em>Nobody?</em></p>
<p>Nobody there. I don’t have a reason, that reason to go back. The only reason I would go back is just to see the country I was born in and brought up in, you know. My childhood basically.</p>
<p><em>Do you, do you speak with your children about em…all your XXXX?</em></p>
<p>Oh yeah yeah, my kids know, because we always like, we talk about how we use to do things, where we use to go, what we use to play, you know like er, we use to have religious festivals, what we use to do there. You know like because, we use to like, it was like, like here, you’ve got cinemas here, there, discos where ever you can go? It was a small town, you didn’t have that much choice but you had to go one place. And er… either you were supervised by adults all the time, whatever you were doing, erm…</p>
<p><em>It was very different?</em></p>
<p>Here it’s very, very different. That’s why we’ve got more morale, or more values for adults…than the kids here basically.</p>
<p><em>And where did you meet your husband?</em></p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p><em>Here? And where was he working?</em></p>
<p>He is, when I met him he was working for er…um…Department for Employment.</p>
<p><em>OK.</em></p>
<p>Ya.</p>
<p><em>So you whilst you were working at the Ministry of Defence, he was working at the…</em></p>
<p>Department for Employment, yeah.</p>
<p><em>And did he come from Uganda or was he…</em></p>
<p>No, no, no, he’s from Dar es…he was born in Dar es Salaam but he was from India.</p>
<p><em>Did he leave around the same time? Because a lot of…</em></p>
<p>I think, they, he left in seventy nine. He left, seventy…five. And we left in seventy two. He left a couple of years after us.</p>
<p><em>And does he have like a similar, to er, Tanzania or…?</em></p>
<p>No doesn’t have any attachment he was only one or two when he left Dar es Salaam, so for him, Dar es Salaam is just a country he was born in, nothing, no attachment at all. Er…he’s got more attachment to India than here, because he was brought up er… in India. Sorry…</p>
<p>[LONG PAUSE]</p>
<p><em>What was your time like in India, when you first went there, because if you… were born in er, Lugazi…?</em></p>
<p>You see, I …I … I basically didn’t do any education, or anything, all for me…</p>
<p>[INTERVIEWEE TALKS TO FRIEND]</p>
<p>… it’s ok. For me was to, look around and…enjoy myself basically.</p>
<p><em>In India?</em></p>
<p>In India. [LAUGHS]. Me and my other cousin, he was there and none of us…we went for education but most of us, because of what happened in Uganda, we got stuck. So we stayed with em, my cousin, cousin sister’s house. and er…all we use to do we go out every day, go meet other Ugandan students who, you know, they came before us but they were actually in universities there. So we went and…stayed with them and you know…</p>
<p><em>Socialising?</em></p>
<p>Socialising until we got the chance, both of us, and we both came back together.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Me and my cousin and like, he’s elder brother was actually in education in Bengal so we went to see, stay with him. And you know, things like that so…we had more of er…going everywhere but deep down, because we was young aswell, you didn’t know whether, what was happening to you. Because like none of us, even though are parents kept saying, we’ll sort you out but you’ve got to wait, the uncertainty, there was uncertainty, what was happening. And er…things like, what would happen tomorrow, what will…if they call us or… if we can’t afford to…make us study…there was, there was, such a lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p><em>How long were you in India for?</em></p>
<p>Em...about six, seven months.</p>
<p><em>So not too long.</em></p>
<p>Not too long.</p>
<p><em>But I guess everyday that you were there, you didn’t, you didn’t know what was happening.</em></p>
<p>We didn’t know. When we came, like obviously my mum and dad, they came without anything. I mean I started working for Tesco’s, whatever salary I got I use to spend each and every penny and get food, like blanket one day, pillows the next day, you know things like that.</p>
<p><em>So you were talking about how you use to give your salary from Tesco to your parents and help them get like, pillows and…</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Like I use to go and get you know, shop, you know, because obviously we came with nothing, we didn’t had, enough essentials so you had to go and buy everything and like everything XXX first you need something that will warm you up. My salary and my brother’s salary basically went on my…stuff for house.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember what you use to get paid?</em></p>
<p>Ah can’t remember but it wasn’t much.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>But at that time, things weren’t very expensive either. I remember milk was just a penny or something, and er…so it wasn’t, very expensive.</p>
<p><em>What was your brother doing?</em></p>
<p>My brother initially he…er, when he came he started working, er…in a factory somewhere. Then after, went, we all settled down he actually finished his education as a civil engineer.</p>
<p><em>And how did your… how did your mum and your dad cope, when they, when they came to Britain?</em></p>
<p>Em, my mum still can’t speak English but she was a good, er, hand communicator. So you’ll, she would go to the shop and say, show people what she wanted and how many, she wanted. Because it was a small town, people would help, you know in a…near a small green grocers we use to go to, and stuff like that. And when I was working, I would get other things which I needed from em, on the way, Thursdays and Saturdays when I use work. First I initially I worked full time in Tesco’s so I use to get.</p>
<p>[INTERVIEWEE SPEAKS TO CUSTOMER].</p>
<p>But then afterwards, XXXX part time when I started my education. My parents was a strong believers in education, so he made sure all us even though we were struggling, had an education.</p>
<p><em>And, what about your dad, how did he find settling into Britain?</em></p>
<p>He…took in his stride as it came. I guess, like er, he came from a, when he was fourteen in he came, he started working so all his life he was working.</p>
<p><em>Do you know what he was doing when he came to Uganda, when he was fourteen, was he working on the railways or was he in the factory?</em></p>
<p>No, no he was working in a restaurant in India when they spotted my dad. You know the Mehta group must have came there and they said er, ok do you want to come with us, to cook for them, my father actually went to Africa with them as a cook.</p>
<p><em>And what part of er, India, is your family originally from?</em></p>
<p>Gujarat.</p>
<p><em>Gujarat. So he came alone, and started his life there and…met your mum and had you guys. Do you think that he had, ever feel like he missed Uganda, do you think?</em></p>
<p>I think so. I think so, because being in countryside, you didn’t have anybody to communicate to and stuff like that, but afterwards, you know, er, you get use to it but initially it was hard. You know being like, big family, there was always somebody there. So…life XXXX, different things.</p>
<p><em>Cos there's, there’s like, there’s a large, obviously Asian community, er Ugandan Asian community in Leicester and other parts of London, when you guys were living in Huntingdon, how did you cope with like, not having your, your, normal Asian foods, your spices?</em></p>
<p>Well initially we didn’t know. One day my brother and my younger brother were…went out to do some shopping and they were carrying, like, blankets and stuff back. And…there was another Asian family who lived in this country longer than us. And they spotted another Asian, they stopped the car, and said er…are you from Ugand…er…they say er…do you need help? And my brother said, yeah, we wouldn’t mind you know. Er, and they asked us, in English they started talking initially because they didn’t know what…</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>…background we were from. And it happened that they were gujarati aswell , and they kept XXXX my brother, at home, and my mum obviously being a hostess she made tea and that, they started chatting and then they said, you won’t get any Asian food here but , there's all like all like, town, like London, or…Huntington where you can get it. and er, it’s a XXXX, when we go we get XXXX for you. And because my cousin settled in London, he…gave, he knew where you could get Asian foods, my brothers use to come down and XXXX, and get food back. But like chapatti flour and that, they use to make do with er, bread making flours and stuff like that. But initially, after that they found this person, and whenever he use to go, he use to bring stuff, heavy stuff for us because we didn’t have a car.</p>
<p><em>What about celebrating like Diwali, or any religious festivals, in Huntingdon?</em></p>
<p>XXXX. well there was no such celebrations, as I said three families. So we use to get together on Diwali days , you know just, and light some candles and stuff like that, just to make it a little, er… something, er, different and er, all, we use, all three families were together in one place and did things, and then, next day, you’ll go to somebody else’s house. And then we, kinda celebrate that way.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. As a community, even though it was a small community you still come together. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Were they from Uganda aswell or were they…</em></p>
<p>Same town as us.</p>
<p><em>Really?</em></p>
<p>It happened, one of them were from same town as us, one from Kampala, so…there was like three, er…families.</p>
<p><em>You were saying there was like a Lugazi, like community, that you were involved in or set up.</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>What was that?</em></p>
<p>About few years back we decide that er, all the people from Lugazi have a get together. And we all organised it and had a sort of like a dinner and dance kind of thing. People who left Uganda, Lugazi, like even my classmates and stuff like that we haven’t seen them for ages. Some of them you do, we still have a contact, some you don’t. and we sent it out to as many people we knew, we first organised a sort of like an address book, we can actually write to people, so like asking do you know of anybody in Lugazi, you know like…</p>
<p><em>This is when you were in Huntingdon, or in London, here?</em></p>
<p>No no, after that, here, about a few years we did it about, say….seven eight years ago we did it.</p>
<p><em>And is that, you and some of your friends, family or like, was there…</em></p>
<p>It was er, a friend of mine and I, and there was somebody else, about four us did it. And we started ringing people round, and because I had a business sort of, I could, you know, people living in Lugazi, I could get people say, oh can you give the address of anybody else, you know, kind of thing, built up a group. And then, we send everybody out. We had a good, turnout believe it or not. People did turn out with their kids, friends, you know…er, husbands and wives, who were not from Lugazi, and sort of like, we made it, but we made it on a wrong day, it was a bank holiday weekend, so…some people had already booked their holidays and stuff like that.</p>
<p><em>You had a good turn out?</em></p>
<p>We had had a good turnout. We had a good turnout. We had about…three hundred people.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em></p>
<p>That’s not bad at all.</p>
<p><em>How did you fund it?</em></p>
<p>We asked people for the money. At er, that would cover the cost of the hall and the food, and the, soft drinks, and er…</p>
