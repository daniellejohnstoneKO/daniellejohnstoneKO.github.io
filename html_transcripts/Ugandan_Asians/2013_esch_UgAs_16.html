<p><em>What was your business like, how was business in mbale, was there a lot of other asian businesses there aswell?</em></p>
<p>Yeah…because er, mostly African in mbale is well off, Kenya XXXX, Uganda was a rich country because coffee, cotton, peanuts, XXXX, growing tea, sugar, so mostly African , majority African was well off and well educated.</p>
<p><em>How many employees did you have?</em></p>
<p>Er…in my shop it was, it was six to seven. And after independent, I opened my shirt manufacturing over there, it was forty five people, in factory.</p>
<p><em>And whas there a mixture of Asians, or were there African Ugandans. </em></p>
<p>Mostly African, mostly African, asian was one or two.</p>
<p><em>And what was it like er, em…the dynamics between the black African Ugandans and the Asians, in business…or just around the city? Did they get along?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. But you know, eighty per cent, you know economy controlled by asian, and the government revenue about eighty per cent, government get easily get eighty percent from asian. At that time asian, don’t send money outside, out of Africa, they invest over there. But after independent people frighten. Because er, general amin everyday give lecture. So after gen…during, general amin time, most asian send money to XXXX. But ten per cent people there, send money but ninety per cent they were happy over there, and applied for Ugandan cizien. I applied for citizenship.</p>
<p><em>Did they give it to you?</em></p>
<p>They didn’t, they didn’t gave me citizen.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Because er [points to back of hand]</p>
<p><em>Because you’re asian?</em></p>
<p>Skin. You know what happened, the first president he was well educated, but geneal amin was illiterate. He came, from poor background and he, himself he wasn’t from Uganda, he was Sudanese. Sudanese refugee settle in kampala, among the the tripozi. General amin born over there.</p>
<p><em>In sudan?</em></p>
<p>Ah. No.</p>
<p><em>In er Uganda, he was born in Uganda. </em></p>
<p>Uganda.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember the things that he use to say in his speeches? Before, before he gave the notice?</em></p>
<p>Ya, because...</p>
<p><em>What kind of things did he use to say?</em></p>
<p>XXXX ordinary speech and most of speech is no sense.</p>
<p><em>Laughs.</em></p>
<p>No knowledge, if he dream, say god tell him to expel asian. He was like just mohaed prophet.</p>
<p><em>Can yuou remember when you heard that, he said he had that dream?</em></p>
<p>Ya.</p>
<p><em>What were you thinking? What was the rest of the asian community thinking?</em></p>
<p>We are laughing.</p>
<p><em>Were the other black Africans laughing at him aswell?</em></p>
<p>And first when he came, people don’t know what he will do. And mostly people think he’s stupid.</p>
<p><em>Laughs.</em></p>
<p>But when he met general gaddafi of Libya, he was crazy man, gadaffai tell them, toldhim, to expel Africa, asian and I’ll give you expert people from Sudan, Libya. XXXX. Because gaffai expel twenty five thousand Italian.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Because Italy got, dominant by Italy before independent. So he made copy of gaddafi. And he don’t know because er, mostly you know, you know all over Uganda there was no single doctor African. No single lawyer, no single engineer. How can you run country without expert? Business, no single people have knowledge. So when we left Uganda, myself, I left everything over there. So when I left within three days, they break my house, my shop and everything. It still, XXXX taken. And some business gave to African, they don’t know how to import things, or how to export. So they, they got goods they sold and then, don’t have resources to getting back. So you know, in…in Jinja, there was a, near Jinja was a town Kikara, sugar. You know everyday you take factory, sugar plantation, everyday they, two thousand bags of sugar was XXXX. Two thousand bags and one bag need one tonne sugar cane. So they, the asian who opened the factory, he whole life awas over there, he know how to plant, and how to cut. So one side they XXXX, other side they cut and again, here, sugar grow, and going constantly without breaking. And when he left Uganda and came here London, production went to two hundred bags. No sugar.</p>
<p><em>That’s it, there was no sugar left.</em></p>
<p>He don’t have enough money to give salary.</p>
<p><em>So that happened a lot after all the Asians left?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. That asian business went, they employed twenty thousand people.</p>
<p><em>From where? From outside?</em></p>
<p>No no. whole Africa.</p>
<p><em>Oh ok, yeah asian recruited yeah. </em></p>
<p>You know, most modern system in Africa was in kikara. School was free, house everything, getting by company.</p>
<p><em>Are you, going back to what you said earlier, you got married in mombassa and your wife was born in Uganda. </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Did you have any children?</em></p>
<p>Yeah I got two daughters.</p>
<p><em>And where were they born?</em></p>
<p>They were born in mbale.</p>
<p><em>Mbale. And what was it like raising children in mbale there?</em></p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p><em>What ws it like raising th children?</em></p>
<p>Ya it was very good.</p>
<p><em>Can you remember celebrating religious festivals?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, many photos. And many I left behind, album. I got one album because when I want to come here i can’t get carrier bag. It was twenty, thirty thousand people left together. So no, there is no single bar in market you can get.</p>
<p><em>What was the area like in mbale, the home that you lived in? the neightbourhood, the community?</em></p>
<p>You know mostly in town, mostly lie upper class African and asian, and some europena. But African mostly live in farm, because they are mostly farmers, they get near town, two miles, three miles, they got plantations, coffee, cotton, so live over there. And mostly they come, they come for work, for cash money they want to work. But food, no need to buy because they get enough food in their farm, mogo, motoki, you know banan…</p>
<p><em>Whats mogo??</em></p>
<p>Motoki you know?</p>
<p><em>No. </em></p>
<p>Is banana. But cooking banana.</p>
<p><em>Like er, plantain? Is it?</em></p>
<p>That banana, banana cook, boil and they eat. Very tasty. I use to eat every week one day, motoki.</p>
<p><em>What was your favourite, er food in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Motoki.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. </em></p>
<p>Motoki, we cook and make like curry. And boil first, and cutting pieces or sometime make just like mash potato and you know, put some oil, onion, tomato and make like curry.</p>
<p><em>Did you cook at home?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>[Laughs] So not just your wife. Both of you cooked at home. And can you remember when he made the announcement and said you have to go? When he told, said he had the dream, you said earlier there was, everybody was laughing they thought it was a joke.</p>
<p>Yeah. First we think, because near mbale, was er, a town was Tororo. Over there is army, army camp. Over there he announced, say all afri…all Asian living in uganda, leave country within three months. So first we shocked, we say crazy, how can you sell your business and your property, who will buy? Africans they can’t buy.</p>
<p><em>And then what happened afterwards, when it started to…</em></p>
<p>First XXXX, we didn’t take seriously, but then army come, everyday in town my businesss was clothing. They buy, don’t pay money.</p>
<p><em>So soliders would come to the shop. </em></p>
<p>Yeah…. By gun. Elecontronic shop, go and say I want this television or other equipement, don’t pay money. Just like robbery, people think that this is something is, and they give warning to bristish high commissioner. You take your people, within three months otherwise I’ll put in jail, in camps, all people, put in camp.</p>
<p><em>So what did your, what did you do afterwards?</em></p>
<p>So…I, I was worrying my brothers family. My brothers got six children, and he don’t have much experience, so I sent my brother first.</p>
<p><em>Sent him to…uk?</em></p>
<p>England.</p>
<p><em>England, yeah. </em></p>
<p>Because that time, that time, was a voucher system. You go to british embassay, , they put stamp on your passport then you get ticket. Then that time,every passport I gave bribe to airways company. Two thousand, three thousand, every passport. I gave bribe about fifty thousand shillings, I send my brother.</p>
<p><em>To the, so you em, bribed the airport staff…the….</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Was that very common?</p>
<p>I think last momement I leave, but er, I book my passport everything ready, ticket everything read, but I want to smuggle, some my goods.</p>
<p>What kind of goods?</p>

<p>Your tailoring stugg, ok.</p>
<p>I want to send Kenya becaseu my elder brother was in Kenya. So station, railways staion was friendly, but I didn’t get chance because everywehere army people watching. So I got notice, forty eight hours, he sayd, people who book, tell ticket leave country within forty eight hours, so I leave, left country within forty eight hours.</p>
<p>So you sent your, your wife and your daughters off first or….they came with you?</p>

<p><em>Can you er, can you remember arriving in um, in the UK, where did you go first, when you came off the plane?</em></p>
<p>You know, I don’t know. But my, earlier I send, I send xxxx. My brother in law already was here. So, they got house, they rented house in Enfield.</p>
<p><em>Enfield?And what was your first thought, when you came off the plane, and you saw, saw London, what were you thinking?</em></p>

<p><em>What was it like when you had to settle, settle in um, Enfield, you stayed with your brother?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Right. </em></p>
<p>Yeah, it was er, it was er, three bedroom house, so one bedroom use me, and two bedroom use my brother’s whole family. So council, not allowed, they, they want to give house at that time, we don’t have knowledge, about benefit system, welfare system. I don’t know anything. Even I went to xxxx exit, I go to, maybe you say, you sign here, I want, I went over, only one time. And then I, I refuse.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Turned back. So I’m, I’m not beggar. I feel like a beggar, I don’t joke. So I came here xxxx….you know up, up Green Street, it is Sorn Road[?], over there my relative…here, er, he told me to come here and I’ll take you Aldgate, east. So I, I came here, from Enfield, and go, gone with him Aldgate. Petticoat Lane.</p>
<p><em>Petticoat Lane, yeah. </em></p>
<p>And I, I go over there, and I didn’t get, tailoring job, but later, garment. As a machinist.</p>
<p><em>Was it in a shop or a factory?</em></p>
<p>No, factory.</p>
<p><em>Factory? What was the factory called, can you remember?</em></p>
<p>Er, I can’t remember name now. But other I remember, ‘cause, ‘cause that factory, I work only two, three days. But other factory was E. Brown.</p>

<p><em>A week?</em></p>
<p>Tax free. That was good, good money. And then I, I, I um, wife say I want to work, so she did, she didn’t know anything over there, she didn’t work. She was house wife. So I, every day I, I took, take my wife to Aldgate, the other clothing factory, for training. Two weeks I take, after two weeks, this, they send her home, trouser, so she, but er, after eight months, I left Enfield and went to Seven Kings, Ilford. Because my friend, my friend was a living there, he, Renault Park[?], he say, he’s plenty house, he has big house. So, two room, separate kitchen [coughs], and thirteen pound rent. So I rent, and over there we, we were overcrowded in that house, so I lived Enfield, and went to Ilford. Seven Kings. And wife, my wife, I worked all sewing my things, xxxx twenty six pound.</p>
<p><em>Twenty pounds? </em></p>
<p>And my wife…working over there weekly, she worked thirteen pound, thirteen pound, so that I, that very good too, rent. And xxxx xxxx, ten pound most cheap, five pound, will get weekly er, shopping. Five pound you’ll get lot of food. So I saved, two years, I saved to other, about two thousand pound. Then I got house, about eleven, eleven and half thousand.</p>
<p><em>Where was the house?</em></p>
<p>In Manor Park.</p>
<p><em>In Manor Park. </em></p>
<p>That house, I, I lived about twenty eight years. After my wife died, in er, nineteen eighty four (1984)…and after six year, I sold that house. And…and that money, I gave my daught-, two daughters, fifty, fifty percent. So that time, er…first the, you know they married well, and the other one married in nineteen…ninety nine (1999).</p>
<p><em>What year were they both born in?</em></p>

<p><em>What year were they both born in? [pause] One was born, you’ve got two daughters?</em></p>
<p>Er, did they, er, yeah. My elder daughter was six years old when I get, and the younger was four years. So, when my wife was xxxx, they say, girl no need much education. So, they left school after A Level, but when my wife died, and that girl say, I want to go to university. Then I, I agree, because er, opposition gone. I, I er, want them, her, them to marry quickly.</p>
<p><em>But you don’t, you didn’t mind?</em></p>
<p>No. I sent her Norwich. And the younger one, sent to America. North Carolina. But unfortunately, I don’t have enough money, so then, after, after BA, they take er…xxxx. Now, they both are teachers.</p>

<p>No, that, that…</p>
<p><em>When did you leave?</em></p>
<p>No that, time, Petticoat Lane, I, I er, E. Brown. I, I…I left that factory, then I opened business my, with my brother in law. Old Street, manufacturing. But er, I didn’t get much money over there. So I left over there, then I start work at home. I go to, for indoors, fashion designer. I was, I make er, fashion designer clothes, sample work. So I got…twenty pound an hour.</p>
<p><em>Working from home?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. It was a much.</p>
<p><em>And how long did you do that for?</em></p>
<p>Er…</p>
<p><em>Just…</em></p>
<p>Few, few months. Then I, I retired. And, then I work the launderette. Alteration work.</p>
<p><em>Where abouts were you working?</em></p>
<p>First, first I went, it was er, near Victoria. Near Pimlico, near.</p>

<p>Near, is, where the market. Over there was a launderette.</p>
<p><em>Is this East London? So you worked in that Launderette?</em></p>
<p>For two, three place I work. Then, in East Ham high street was one launderette.</p>
<p><em>And that was your last job? And what did you find difficult in the beginning when you came to the UK…?</em></p>
<p>Um…</p>
<p><em>What did you find difficult?</em></p>
<p>Difficult to…? Without man power, because I don’t have man power, over there, I look up to about twenty five people. My brothers family, my sister family, my brother in laws family. But my own, here, they settle their own. You can’t get any help from them. So it was more difficult. Because my…my money and everything, I invest among them. To help them, so I left nothing, and when I came here, they are now well off, but they will not, nobody care.</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. </em></p>
<p>Here. So that was difficult.</p>
<p><em>So you miss the family?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, when you don’t have son, or big family.</p>
<p><em>Did you come from a large family? </em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>How many of you was, is there?</em></p>
<p>Three, three brothers. And one, one sister. But all together, we were six brothers. Three died early age. And two sister died. When here, we survived. Three brothers, and their family. So one brothers, half family still live in, in Mombasa. My elder brothers don’t, two daughters, lives in Nairobi, and he, elder son, lives in Mombasa. Still lives in, over there, business.</p>
<p><em>Have you ever been back to Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Er, no, I went, came here twice.</p>
<p><em>When did you go?</em></p>
<p>Oh, last time, nineteen nineties (1990s), six (1996). After that, nineteen ninety five (1995), I went to India. Then, then I went India, ninety five (1995). Er, in, last where they are gone, I only one man I know, er, died many lived, country, in our town. If I go now, nobody knows me. And…be a stranger.</p>
<p><em>You’d be a stranger, in your onw er…?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>In your own town? What did you think when you went back to Kenya for the first time, when you went back to Africa?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, came here it was alright. Because still it is er, many relative lives in Kenya. My, there’s, are two daughters, they are multi millionaire over there.</p>
<p><em>And a lot of er, um, Guajarati community, they came from Uganda, they all, most of them set up their own businesses. Why is that? You said before, you don’t want to be a beggar, you don’t want to sign on?</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Is that something that you have as a family value or…?</em></p>
<p>Yeah we are, I got er, I was problem, because of um, man power. Without man power, I want to open shop here. And my, one of xxxx friend from Uganda, he helped me in Kilburn, Kilburn High Street, it was a one shop, old white man want to retire. And my friend say, I’ll, head in for money from bank. I told, I, told that time, to my brother, and one of the, their son, he come with me. I open shop, but they say, say no. You do your own, if you want. So, without man power, wife, my wife can’t, can’t do that type of work. A girl was er, six and four years old. And then I got problem, my wife got cancer…so I, it last about six years. Xxxx eighty four (1984). I helped to look after her, her lastly, she get blind, spread…I learned to cook. And work at home.</p>
<p><em>And er, raise your daughters?</em></p>
<p>Exact, ‘cause I can’t leave my wife alone. I, work over there, and look after, and cooking for…so it was a very, very hard, hard life. That five, six years, was very difficult.</p>
<p><em>Did you still have family living around, in the area or were they still kind of in Enfield and…?</em></p>
<p>No, I, that time I go.</p>
<p><em>Manor Park?</em></p>
<p>Manor Park.</p>
<p><em>But did you have, was there other um, family members around?</em></p>
<p>No, they come sometimes to visit. But er, who will, xxx xxxx, who will look after her. Nobody. I had to. So I left a job, I work at home. That is history. Now I am free!</p>
<p><em>[laughs]. Where do you, where do you feel like home is? Home, when you think of home, where do you feel like home is? Is it Uganda, Kenya, India…?</em></p>
<p>The best one…Africa wasn’t, it was a golden time. India was alright, but er, that time I was very young. Don’t care about money. And still I, er, Uganda, I don’t care about money. When I came here, I got knowledge that without money, you xxxx xxxx also. But it was, too late. But I am lucky, I still I, I was, my health was very good. You know how, how old I am?</p>
<p><em>You said you were born in nineteen twenty seven (1927), so that makes you…ninety…[laughs]…</em></p>
<p>Xxxx.</p>
<p><em>I can’t count! </em></p>
<p>You know, my real age, I born nineteen twenty four (1924).</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>But my passport, in my passport it was…</p>
<p><em>Twenty seven? (1927)</em></p>
<p>Nineteen twenty seven (1927).</p>
<p><em>Ok. </em></p>
<p>Because I was, when it was er, nineteen thirty eight (1938), my brother was in Tanzania, that time I was, in school. So say, you come here, and got to school here. Because, er, in school, my record was very good, my memory was very good. So that time, I was fourteen years old. My uncle, he…[pause]…</p>
<p>my uncle… tell them…that my… in passport application wrote eleven. Three years less. So I get quickly admission to school. I, I don’t need to change. I didn’t change. And that time I didn’t know what… in nineteen fifty-eight I went to India. That time I went to find my birth date. But they… that time was small hospital. They registered over there. But the… I went to… over there, there is no record. They lost. They record nineteen thirty… before nineteen thirty five there was whole books lost. Then I went to my school. I find record over there. So I… nineteen twenty nine. I admitted in school, that time I was five years old. So if nineteen twenty-nine I was five, it means I born nineteen twenty four. And err… I don’t have English date so I told my daughter XXXX, because it was Diwali. Indian Christmas festival of light. That I remember my mother used to say I born on Diwali. So I told my daughter in 1924 Diwali was…</p>
<p><em>What date was it, yeah?</em></p>
<p>So they find the 27<sup>th</sup> of twelfth 1924 was Diwali. But obviously…</p>
<p><em>Can you remember celebrating Diwali in India?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Because you know, Diwali, I suppose is just like Christmas. A lot of fireworks and everywhere is alight. And small lamp people would use… you know… small lamp, and Bombay city electric.</p>
<p><em>What about celebrating Diwali in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Just like India. Everywhere like that. We meet in New year after Diwali. Second day’s New year. So New Year’s is… was special.</p>
<p><em>What was the, the change like in the culture when you came to… when you came to London? Did you find… how did you find British culture?</em></p>
<p>You know still… still we celebrate Diwali. Still here… but err XXXX they don’t get time to celebrate because not only they XXXX time. So obviously celebrate here, Christmas.</p>
<p><em>Before they made it like a holiday?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, but here in East London, my… they are teacher. So they’re celebrating in school also. And now, now there’s these people also know about Diwali. Diwali is a… about ten thousand years old. Great King XXXX he came to you know… you heard the story of Rama and Sita?</p>
<p><em>Mmm, Rama and Sita yeah, I remember in school?</em></p>
<p>Ravana kidnap his, his wife. He was in exile in jungle. He was prince. XXXX stepmother bought her younger whether to get you know XXXX. So expelled for 14 years in jungle. Over there Rama was queen, king of XXXX. He kidnap Sita. And then um… make war. And release Sita. And then came… after 14 years, came home. That time was everywhere was celebration. That called Diwali… Another story is XXXX Hindu XXXX emperor was Ashoka. So XXXX is Ahoka. Not Jesus Christ XXXX. In India, Ashoka. So it is also… his coronation was on the Diwali. In India, you know, many festival, people before Diwali, twenty days, before is XXXX… it called VJ XXXX… VJ means victory</p>
<p><em>Means?</em></p>
<p>Victory.</p>
<p><em>Victory.</em></p>
<p>That err, they also celebrate in India VJ XXXX. There… one month before it’s Krishna. Krishna birth… born in that month. That also… this whole month is festival. Rama and Krishna. In Indian they say incarnation of God. They will. Hindu philosophy they… they believe God come XXXX… so they, they call God Rama and Krishna. So after… thousands and thousands years. Still, not a… you can’t replace Rama. He’s the ideal. Great son, great husband, great king. And every, everything is great and perfect. And Krishna, he, he wrote Rita… textbook… XXXX… one principle say if you don’t do something for somebody, you, you don’t drink you’ll get Rita, without Rita, what do you call? My English not very good.</p>
<p><em>Don’t worry, it’s okay. </em></p>
<p>Because they… if you do something for someone, this is not business, so in business if you sell, you get money. You think you can help somebody, you help, but then forget. So I… I think this is a great thing, because then you don’t regret. Just like me. Sometimes I look after about 25 people. Now 25 look after only one. But this is the wrong thinking. But God gave me… sent… so I still I look after myself. I don’t need any help. Even my daughters sometimes say ‘don’t go shopping. I send somebody. They will deliver it you at home’. No, I don’t want help. It is good. So Gita says [QUOTES THEN TRANSLATES INTO ENGLISH FOR THE INTERVIEWER] Do but don’t think to get something back. Do, and forget. Then you’ll get okay. Because you hurt… if you think you’ll hurt yourself, they don’t know. You hurt yourself, all the time, with your thinking. So, you forget it.</p>
<p><em>These the… the principles you passed onto your daughters</em></p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p><em>The principles you passed onto your daughters? Those morals?</em></p>
<p>My daughter is a… they are great. Very kind. Very helpful to people, and profession is noble profession: teacher. So their…. their thinking is very good.</p>
<p><em>In terms of culture, do they feel Ugandan, do they feel Indian, feel British do you know?</em></p>
<p>They’re international</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Because they married English… no a, them… married English boy. So international. Indian, Indian, African</p>
<p><em>And you… international?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. And you know… in world, we are one family. If you near the equator, you are black. You go to north, you’re skin get redder. If you go to Australia, after thousand year’s times you’ll get face like Aboriginie, because nature change. If you live in China, your face, your features in this en-… face will be like Chinese. So I know now that this is all one family. People from Kenya, from Africa, after Sahara Desert, climate change, and then people migrate, go to Asia, go to Europe, and spread all over, but quite a lot of life is Africa. So if you acknowledge, if you go to India, you’ll get XXXX face. You’ll get black. If you go to South India, it’s a black… your hairs not curly, but it’s it’s about climate</p>
<p><em>It’s true</em></p>
<p>In Kerela, they, they were 28,000 years ago. They came from Africa to settle down. But they very… if you go, because Kerela is near the equator. XXXX, near XXXX is equator passing in the Indian Ocean. XXXX are near Uganda, so also is equator. In Kenya, there’s a railway station, and then there’s the equator. On the equator. Station is equation. Over there, is 3,000, 9,000, feet. On… from slave labour. So at night, freezing cold. In the day, is very hot</p>
<p>[BACKGROUND CONVERSATION]</p>
<p>So in India, mostly people migrate. XXXX was a white, they settle in north. Still, in South is an area, not Ayrian. They live together, and now, is mixed blood. Half is Ayrian, and Ayrian is white. XXXX is Ayrian. Greek, Ayrian. German, Ayrian. Een Turkey is Ayrian.</p>
<p><em>So now that it’s been almost 41 years now, since Idi Amin made the announcement, how do you think the story of Ugandan Asians should be remembered?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, I’m happy we are here. Because… and sad about Uganda, because we were, over there found with twenty shilling. Now is 2,500 shilling. One pound. No value. If you go to, to buy 1 loaf bread you need, you need note like this. But they ruin economy. It happens in India also. India, 1947, was patrician. India and Pakistan. Now, Pakistan, big port was Karachi. Was commercial capital. After independent people migrate from, from Pakistan left mostly non-Muslim. Left country, and went Hong Kong. Hong Kong economy was moving. After China get Hong Kong from Britain, now people left Hong Kong, went to Australia. Now Australian economy was booming. XXXX like, you know Green Street? You know XXXX also. When I came here there was one shop in Green Street. Now Green Street hardly… you’ll find anything over than Asian, apart from Tesco. And that time, you know, this Newham was poor. Now, Newham is rich. Council get lot of money, because lot of rent, so Asian’s don’t ruin the economy. And Africa as you know, wasn’t XXXX… when all the Asian left, country gone back. Because all Asian believes we are leaving here. I money, we are investing here. Not in, in Switzerland, and not America, not India. Just like Uganda, that time, they earn money and invest over there, so economy boom, was booming. After World War, Nairobi, Mombasi, XXXX big city built by Asian. Ruling by XXXX, by British, Britain time was safety. In Africa they, they don’t know how to rule. They were, they were not ready, because after India get independence, all over the world was a XXXX to get rid of… some country was ready, some country wasn’t ready. So, white people gone, and black rulers came and put money in XXXX, his pocket. It’s like Somalia. How many years? Still fighting. Ethiopia, Eritrea, fighting. Kenya, some tribe, XXXX. They say ‘we are superior’ because XXXX was XXXX. XXXX say that. The community is XXXX… Just like in Pakistan. Pakistan, probably XXXX, they have nothing. Five per cent, or two per cent people, they’re controlling all the economy. So after freedom, some people say before freedom they were happy. In here, also is five per cent people controlling, but here is different because everybody got guarantee from Queen. XXXX you will get. Clothing, and benefit. Education is free. The poor, in medical… doctor and hospital is free. XXXX is free. So, people don’t have a jealousy of, of parliament, member of parliament, because basic requirements: food, shelter, here people getting. In our country, you, you, you don’t have any, you can’t get a doctor, you can’t get education, you can’t get shelter. Here is welfare state. Third world, there is no welfare state. Money, they get five percent XXXX themselves. Ninety-five per cent… have nothing.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. Are you, are you glad you settled in Britain?</em></p>
<p>Ah?</p>
<p><em>Are you glad you settled in Britain?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, ’cos at least my future generation, they have safety here, and good future, no discrimination.</p>
