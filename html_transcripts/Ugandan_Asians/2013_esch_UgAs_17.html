you want to talk about Uganda and the relationships between the Asians and the indigenous Ugandans you must understand that when I came here, I was only 14 and my experience of Uganda was my schooling days okay, during my schooling days my father had a tailoring shop and we were in a small place called Tabira Miro which was where I was born and that town just had two streets and very few Asian communities. During the time obviously we had good relationships with the workers people who were working with my dad’s shop who were tailoring for him using the sewing machines, people who were doing the stitching work. Which were the usual Ugandans that were doing the work and coming back to the house work the guys who were working for us because we did not have taps so we had to go to the well, to bring the water so they had to take the wheelbarrow and drums to fill up the water and bring it back now with all of these guys the relationship was cordial it was family you trusted them you lived with them and in fact we grew under them so if a guy worked for you it was forever like permanent employment so for a lot of them when we departed it was a shock because they did not know who was going to employ them and pay them so that was yes when Idi Ahmin looked at it he looked at it as more of a commerce situation okay in commerce you guys are far ahead and when cant the Ugandans do it and he was probably cannot confirm it but maybe he was looking for an excuse to see what he could do to empower the Ugandans the indigenous Ugandans and in the midst of that I think somewhere somebody misadvised him or whatever had happened and for sort of reasons he had a vendetta probably because the Israelis were building the Uganda airports they were doing the military barracks so a lot of work was being done by the Israelis and then I think stepped in Libya so whatever politically has happened I was too young to understand the politics of eth time so I can’t really tell you more about it but looking at it in hindsight I assume he was misguided and then personal ego probably came into it and whatever he had in this mind, this probably had him to have difficulty with Britain and a little but with the US with the west I would say and that probably led to again the expulsion of the Asians and then we are coming back to what we have spoken about as to how Britain took us on. So that side of it was my experience of Uganda and living in Uganda for the time that I could probably understand. And then having come here and reading and understanding and then you try and see the reason for his behaviour of course today people back in Uganda has tremendously flourished Uganda has been very well with the finding of oil and everything so the economy wise Uganda is doing fantastic is growing for eth past 20 years at 5/6% which is fantastic compared to Europe growth it is a steady growth, and the kind of business for example that the English used to do is now in the hands of the Ugandans, so they are running the shops, the small wholesalers and things like that. The Asian that have gone back are doing tremendously well have gone more into manufacturing base of course the Ugandans so have been very successful and gone into manufacturing the agriculture has been taken to new dimensions as well. So the growth of eth country has certainly happened but where it still needs is that the Asians understood the Ugandans if we take the take the British or Europeans to go so they will more look at it in economics terms the economics on the affinity to xx the people is different from what we had, I when I go back it is like homecoming. So it is a different feeling altogether even if I went for business my feeling would still be different towards the country than economics, so this other like of things I feel that Uganda xxxx and why we are going to be celebrating this 40 years of us being in this country I think it has also been to leverage the experience that we have had in this county and then trying to go back which is why you see a lot of eth Ugandan diasporas that was spread probably all over African are looking to go back cos they think youngsters like yourselves who feel there are much more opportunities now in the respective countries of our origins came from. So we are all now looking okay if I do get an education here if I can’t get a job what will I do? And if you feel you have an opportunity to go back it is still in your of your mind to go and do it and I think it’s a great thing, because the success of Africa as a continent is that it is learning pretty fast as well as it is in the mode of development if you look at India for example it was African is where India was maybe 20 years ago. So with the help then process will be quicker because they have learnt people have learnt the financiers have learnt so everybody is now trying to see if we can get err growth rates in 5-10 years time rather than 20 or 30 years time so the catching up process will be …. Also the thanks to the internet and everything education system, is faster people are smarter, people have more access to information now so all of that is progressive and better for the country and the growth of the country. So that so my feedback to you of my vision of Africa or Uganda going forward.</h3>

Obviously the economics was driven by but then again it’s like the happiness index for me was very high in Uganda because the GDP and all that xxx and it doesn’t mean to even people today because do I have a job yes … am I happy? Yes, Am I content yes, am I managing my day to day needs, I am fine. So that index is very high compared to Britain because in Britain everybody is probably unhappy despite having everything. So that is the way I see Uganda vies a vi life in Britain.</h3>

1 was that I was as a youngster where will I find my roots back because even when we were in Uganda the roots were there but to follow the faith Islam or Hinduism or whatever it was that faith was being followed through eth temple or the Mosque and the time when we came here there were dotted temples and then what happened is that then the community came and they started smaller places and now you can see for example the big icon in Neasden yeah the xxxxx temple the equivalent one not far from Nita cash and carry on Ealing road just by Alperton station that is another big one and then like that in Crawley where very you go in Luton so wherever you go most of the palaces have, then you have the Watford Hari Krishna temple the xxx temple and then you have the one in Soho square in Tottenham court Road so there so a lot of temples came about. However for me it was not just that it was beyond because religion is more than just a book it is more than a ritual that understanding came and then I joined the institute of Indian culture which is called xxxxxxxx to bring in the culture activities like the Indian music and traditional dancing the languages the different musical instruments so we created xxxxx which was established in oxford street in a very small palace and today it is flourishing in west Kensington it’s a huge academy and all the kind of whatever you need about Indian culture you can see it so things like that I got involved in and then we started getting accreditation for Gujarati language GCSE up to a level and things like that. Then now Oxford has Islamic studies then there is Hindu studies and all these things. This has come about, very much after because as I say to you rituality is fine in the temples and that is xxxxx you go there and whatever you believe in there a church a cross or whatever so after that what is that we need to take from so called religion into something to make Britain a more beautiful place because we have come from different diversities so how do you make this more cosmopolitan society, how do you interact to learn from each other and I think that adds colour to live err if you look now for example the last few years you know all the festivities are being celebrated in Trafalgar square for example and why because people are evolving people are understanding each other and that is very important because otherwise through ignorance religion is an excuse to fight, to create trouble but when you have an understanding of the faith and ten culture it becomes more beautiful that is how I see it and that is why hence I am involved with Tamil academy to work of imagination and the scared the sacred to me does not matter to me whether I call it Islam and yesterday as I was saying we were doing work on Sufism today I am doing work on xxxxx then after that we are doing Persian studies so I have involved myself and thanks to Britain again gave me the opportunity to involve myself in different aspects of it like Mosaic networking again going to schools talking …. The connotation was that it was funded, and that okay that because of what happened Islam was being picked on okay whatever the notion it is beyond I don’t look at anybody should be picked on for as an individual their faith and understanding in more important erm no finger is not the same so you are always going to get kind of people who are not understand things from the way it has to be understood for whatever reason and I am not here to judge mental; everybody’s right if you ask a thieve is he right yes he is right because that is my job- morally it may not be so I believe that we have to give education was very important so education means everything learning each other’s cultures is everything learning each other’s cultures education is everything when a child starts to walk is also educating how to walk. So education is very important we do work through xxxxxx Education I am a patron of it helping again to provide DVDs in different languages and it might be across Africa maybe we are doing a lot in south Africa we have done a lot in Sudan we are doing work in Kenya we are doing work in Zambia, we are doing work in Malawi, Ugandan of course through Mali clinic and across the far East as well as Latin America as well so trying to help err because ultimately the world is becoming smaller because of technology and where you can repeating things it is better to see how you can pull on each other’s strength and go forth </h3>

So when they all came here we were put into support from this resettlement board everything so the goal was we need a job, we need to get going it’s not worth sympathising, need to work need to do it. So our attitude was very important and I think it was our attitude that bought success. Of course there were difficulties in the 70s unemployment err the likes of the BNP Enoch Powell so there was a lot of hesitancy and again we understood that suddenly an influx of people coming, when there is huge problems here and people felt that okay so people though these guys are coming, so they are given priority over housing or whatever whatever …. There was resentment which I understand. But knowing all that, we did and sometimes. I try and see ourselves to the way Japan developed after the second world war because they had one religion, one goal, one language so we came with one goal that now we are here this has got to be home we have got to make it and with that spirit, with that attitude we did what we did and because, as I said a lot of them were small business the corner shop fitted in quite nicely. So that is how the families started growing and then again we were joined families right so supposing one guy was earning money as the father now suddenly the children are grown up and did not want to go study some did even in my generation, second generation xxxxxx didn’t go for further education as much as probably now my kids do because to them it is very, very important for me it is important education for my age it was for work and get on with it. So then the money started coming in the weekly pay packet started coming in and jointly families obviously you have economies of scale so you then ownership of housing came in so things like that were happening which probably attributed to our success and why we are …. And again as a community we realised that yes we have to move on and yes we do want to get on and yes we were probably adjusted because we lived in Africa and we were more adaptable to situations more language learning as well, because we all spoke the local district language as well as Swahili and whatever else we there so all of these things were ingredients to the success.</h3>

Piece works means that big factories like Ms Selfridge gave orders then they would send it to your home and you would seems on the side or somebody would put the sleeves on so then it went from you to another house to another house so that kind of work was outsourced so that was and they went to work in Tesco’s, they went to work in airports and it was work and it was not shameful about things…… </h3>
