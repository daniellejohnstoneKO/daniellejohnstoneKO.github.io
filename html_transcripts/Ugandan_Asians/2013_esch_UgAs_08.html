And er they all have polio and er I set up a charity called polio children er to take them to university so at that stage when I looked at it I thought look I would not be standing here if my father had not educated me period. So I stood there and I said if I can’t only take five kids to university er I will have taken I will have done my life’s dream, you know I will have accomplished something. Last June we took our145th kid to university, so it’s priceless that sort of thing you know to get that feeling. So and we’ve we’ve built a hostel for girls er 440 girls er so they can have some sort of of future, they they started studying, one girl became a doctor and things like that. So they they I’ve I’ve actually imposed a bit er on my kids er of this onto my kids you know, on my kids and they’ve taken that up as well, saying let’s look forward you know, our family doesn’t mean ours only its it’s a wider family, and much bigger family and and whenever we can XXXX that’s all, and to me that’s good cos a lot of friend’s children, they’ve started er participating.

You know we didn’t get, very few families got dispersed they were still in a unit, so those families were actually not well off in Uganda, suddenly started having four or five breadwinners in one family, and and that you have together with the family values of everyone staying together of everyone chipping in together, you know it’s amazing how much you can do because of that. So it lasted for I think that was one of the reasons, also we wanted to make up for the lost ground you know, the fact that you know we had all left everything behind. We didn’t we we didn’t lose much back in Uganda because my dad was a teacher and his his house was government quarters and everything else but er we had a career to build otherwise otherwise we would have been back to square one. And my dad knew it, no way did he want us to go back to India so so, it’s the fear of er losing it all what we had again I think made sure that we we we we went the extra mile or you know we stepped it up a lot erm [PAUSES] I think I think to be honest the the [PAUSES] it’s not just hard work, to be successful in Britain was a no brainer [LAUGHS]. You know, you you can’t go wrong.</h3>

Erm there were a lot of corner shops that needed sorting out in London, and there how how better than to have a shop and and a place to live above it, all in one. So job and occupation at the same time, erm the all our kids got a head start into education, you know into better schools that were much much better than we would have had had they had continued their studies in Africa. Erm for the Africans I’m even more pleased because I think er because you did it very brutally at least you did something for the second or third generation afterwards who can proudly say yes the country belongs to them, and er they they they can see certain future in their own country, which would not have happened if the Asians were there, cos the Asians definitely would have been a stumbling block.</h3>
