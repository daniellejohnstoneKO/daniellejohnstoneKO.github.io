<p><em>Ok. Can I ask your name please?</em></p>
<p>My name is Shaukat Khan.</p>
<p><em>And can you spell that for me, please?</em></p>
<p>It’s S-H-A-U-K-A-T K-H-A-N.</p>
<p><em>That’s perfect. Ok Dr. Khan we are ready to go then. Right so we discussed previously before I turned on the recording device about your sort of er... role within the resettlement board of the Uganda Nations. Can I take you back to that time and perhaps discuss the nature of society and race relations within Britain from your arrival, you arrived in 1964.</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Can you perhaps describe your own XXXX?</em></p>
<p>Yes. I think that when [COUGHS] obviously, when I arrived in er.. November 20... er... 1964 [CLINKING SOUND] I mean for me it was er.. [COUGHS] not only a cultural shock, but environmental shock [SNIFFS] because I came from a very warm, hot country er.. to a very dark er.. foggy, cold London [SNIFFS] er.. and where the nature of society was totally different than ours because ours was more open er... here it was very much your house is your castle, so your very much indoors and with the cold weather; [SNIFFS] but, as I obviously got used to it lived there I felt that there was er... this kind of erm.. cold hostility erm... it probably had much to do with the er.. obviously, environment which, I didn’t understand at that time because my image of England and London was what we read in books and what we saw in the sort of sometimes films about the British Raj and so on so [SNIFFS] that... you felt that you were a part of it, and when you came here it was a difference. It was much, much later that I realised that we were talking about a two different nations [COUGH] the one that who ruled they were the different kind of people and the one that is an ordinary working class people that [SNIFFS] who probably er... had no knowledge or no experience as much as this so over who just coming out of the war and so on [SNIFFS] and erm... so I think that there was this erm... cold hostility, erm... I mean my problem was that a: there was language problem because you weren’t able to communicate er.. very well [CLINKING SOUND] and secondly that there was the issue of knowing the XXXX... because were come from a very secure very er... er... religious environment to a totally different and erm... so that I think that there was the, the initial difficulties but as we, we settled in and we started finding that there issues that which, erm.. er were coming out a bit more open in the sense that you er... started understanding the issue of racial violence, hatred the.. the... the people putting up or seeing on TV as well putting notice board ‘no blacks here’, and erm... and you were becoming to feel you were different and erm I think it was in the late sixties that when erm... we saw the growth of ‘Paki-bashing’ which, erm... I think brought home the message that you are literally not secure, in a sense, that you could be XXXX particularly in Walthamstow where in the High Street, every Saturday when they put the shopping day [SNIFFS] er... that you will see gangs of white youths having sticks in there hands and then beating any young Pakistani they see. Er.. and this will go.... [SNIFF] and the obviously it was fearful in that sense and er... secondly, it was that who do we turn to? Erm.. it seemed that the police wasn’t paying that much attention they will say well ‘Do you recognise them?’ Well of course it’s difficult to when you see a crowd of people that when you’re being beat and so on you may recognise but where do you find them? How do you describe them? You can describe them by clothes and so on but they say ‘Ok, well fine, we’ll we can’t do anything’. And I think that it was that kind of er…environment that when we started sort of er.. getting the feeling that we must do something there was no community organisation at that time there was no community relations council and so on, so the only group of people that who were bit vocal were the churches and particularly one or two churches in the High Street area where because they were on the forefront [SNIFFS] and so there was this kind of reaction from some of the young people that we were going to either working or going in the evening classes and so on that who felt that well er.. when you get your own er... mother or sister being beaten up or when there’s their jewellery snatched and so on or abuse and so on they, they, they just couldn't sit there so they started reacting. You also had the same going on not only on the, the High Street but also on the buses, particularly the Chingford area that anyone that who ... erm you know those days they were open buses driver and conductor so it was easier for them somebody get on beat up and go. And that area was particularly notorious because that it was like er.. you were feeling like that you were in South Africa or Rhodesia there are no go areas but, obviously people most of the conductor’s this was a job that they were getting in the buses. So you were hearing reports of erm... conductors being beaten up er.... and again correction and erm... er... or at least that was the feeling that white people not.......</p>
<p><em>So I mean would you... I mean would you... I mean the way that your describing it to me is it almost as if society is becoming polarized based on race and ethnicity? </em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Is that the sort of sense?</em></p>
<p>The, the trouble is when you always have this silent majority they sit at home and they do nothing then, then you have even if a small crowd of people er...for victims its the whole world and I think that was the.. and the only er.. people that who we thought could protect us are the police, a law enforcing agency and then there was very er... great silence on that part or at least report that no nobody has been arrested or so on [CLINKING SOUND] and erm... you couldn't get witnesses erm.... strangely and I think until the other people thought well ‘Ok, if were going to be beaten up well we at least will retaliate’, so they started to have sticks and they went through XXXX. The people like myself at that time were er.. reluctant and were discouraging I said ‘don’t beat up any white person er.. young person because they just happen to be white if you somebody hits you then you hit back but, not the innocent victim otherwise we are doing the same thing that like anybody else is and it’s not their fault’ and then maybe I’d sympathize and so on. [SNIFFS] But I think that what they did was that two or three weekends then there's everybody started in action and suddenly the police started acting and I think that it was [COUGHS] then found out some of the police officers were just turning a blind eye and they were er.. if they were not encouraging openly well they were certainly not discouraging, [LAUGHS] and I think at that time that you started getting groups of people coming together and I remember in High Street I think it was ’67 around that time that the erm... church started erm.. organising a community organis... and that was C.A.R.D (Campaign Against Racial Discrimination) was set up there was I don’t remember his name Reverend who was an Afro-Caribbean er...er... who, who more or less was leading it [SNIFFS] and so from there that these suddenly people thought we need to collaborate and like minded people and so that campaign against racial discrimination became a focal point in, in raising the issue because then collectively we could talk with the police officers, collectively we tell the councillors, collectively with local members of Parliament and so on [SNIFFS] and I think it was er.. <strong>Eric Decans (Derek Deacon?)</strong>, if I remember that he was a member of Parliament at that time, Labour one it was er... er a great help, so at least suddenly that some sort of mechanism started [CLINKING SOUND] working out but, obviously what is was doing was exposing more and more the racism that existed er... underneath that one and erm... and I think it was erm... [SNIFFS] the, the, the suddenly the flash point came when er... er... Younis Khan, a local residence erm... just off the Queen’s Road they created one block, which is Younis Khan Road. [COUGHS] Erm... his family was burnt er... alive he survived but all his wife and three children were dead. I think that brought out the, the full force of this, this feeling and so on one hand you had the erm... National Front coming in the force to say look ‘these er’.... whatever the message was clearly ‘these black people are not wanted’ and there’s a kind of message is blunt they say ‘you can get a house if you get rid of them’, ‘You can get a job’ this one....</p>
<p><em>I think if, if one thing the B.N.P and the N.F can be accused of over the years is being quite blunt [LAUGHS] I means lets.......</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yeah. Well you, you knew that there they say and they play on people’s emotions, which anybody will do that are political parties so yeah they were very blunt they say ‘You are unemployed there’s a black man there, get him out’......</p>
<p><em>Its bread and butter politics isn’t it? </em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Which, Which er.. to a lot of people appealed and said that well [COUGHS] but when they are vulnerable and so on [CLINKING SOUND] so I think that, that, that, er... that was that was a flash point [COUGHS] and I think it raise whole range of issues, whole range of things it brought so you had the Anti-Nazi Leagues coming in then er.... I think that there were groups that you more or less kept capitalised on that er.. and exploited it [COUGHS] for various reasons, but at the other hand er.. a lot of people felt that they were some groups that they could join in and so on [COUGHS] and obviously I became myself very active part of that one.</p>
<p><em>So, I mean if you can give us sort of an overview of this period when you arrived up until sort of the late sixties and perhaps even then the early seventies erm... I mean it seems.. a ver... a period of quite a lot of agitation within the community that seemed to be based on ethnic and racial alliance...</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>However, at the same time it seems that the… sort of the.. the not native community lets say they actually organised themselves very quickly as a reaction</em>.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><em>So that’s....</em></p>
<p>I think that yes. I mean that that XXXX bear in mind that the flux of the immigration was around sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five [COUGHS] and the other flash point at which er... I think triggered it more erm... I think openly erm.... was the Enoch Powell speech erm... where he said ‘that the, the country will be erm’... I think that ‘there’ll be rivers of blood and cultural pollution’ and so on. So, yes your right that this was a period when suddenly people er... who er... initially, I mean a lot of people er... that I was obviously young but my parents and family and of the same time, they came believing that they are here for temporary they’re not going to stay here so therefore, it was turning the other cheek. Er... and they say ‘Ok. If somebody abuses us it’s ok we will just pass time and go back’, but I think that as it grew more younger people came and people thought well we are going to live here [COUGHS] whatever years so we can’t just live in fear and so on.</p>
<p><em>This can’t carry on </em></p>
<p>So yes it, it was so er... while it was er.. I think confronting the [COUGHS] force of all those racism and er... kind of erm.. groups and so on... but, it also enabled people to group together, to start looking at their role and start looking at the what can be done and getting people of common mind. So therefore, you had then the comm.. race.. er [COUGHS] Community Relation Council, being set up, which under the government then they say well we need to do it because we don’t want to.....collaborate and so on. So yes a lot of action then started happening...</p>
<p><em>Mmm…</em></p>
<p>And I think people started suddenly feeling that we can do something we can’ just sit and be, be, be either turn our face around or turn the other cheek round [COUGHS] we need to work with people, we need to do something. So yes it was er... brought some positive changes as well.</p>
<p><em>Mmm...And do you feel, I mean you’ve sort...you’ve..., as you’ve stated the early sixties early to say mid-sixties was a period of..... I mean... I’d go as far to say mass migration to England....</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>Compared to historical migration...</em></p>
<p>Yep...</p>
<p><em>Erm.. certainly London as well and obviously it’s not just the numbers also its migrants from a specific geographical area.......</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Erm.. in the other part of the world.......</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><em>...Let’s say. Quite a concentrated area.....</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>...Relatively speaking...</em></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>...As well to come to another concentrated area......</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>In this part of London. Erm.. Did you notice there was more perhaps prejudice and anti-migrant agitation at erm... during periods where more migrants were coming in – Do you think it was a directly correlated with numbers? Would you say?</em></p>
<p>I think so I think that the [COUGHS] you had the... obviously erm... er.. I mean it’s... it’s natural in one sense that where you erm... seen a transformation a change in the local structure particularly in the East of London where you had come out of the war there’s been a lot of things going on, lot of erm.. people killed people just building up things and then their suddenly seeing a large influx of people who were not only of different colour but of different culture, of different erm.. faiths and so on and most of them congregating in same areas for their own protection or for instance; I mean if my father came he said ‘well where do you want’... he said ‘Oh well I know somebody there’ so you built it up so therefore there were more visible than they were actually numbers but er.... you [COUGHS] er...it’s nature people feel insecure what’s going to happen now this is our land this is our country and their getting all the kind of benefit or their getting the.. and the fact was that they were um.. hard work they wanted to earn money so they were often working twelve to fourteen - sixteen hours er...therefore earning bit more money and so on and here was er.. a community that who were not because they were no opportunities, but they didn’t wanted to work they said well I want to only work eight hours [BEEPING SOUND] for five er... yet there they could see that they was well I’m earning [PHONE RINGS] sixty pounds somebody else is earning two hundred pounds [COUGHS] this was seen as, as a unfairness and so on and then there’s when you reinforce by TV and other people like Enoch Powell says ‘You know it’s our culture it’s being polluted’ and so on, it registers, it’s, it’s, it’s, a natural it would happen in any other society as well and I think that [COUGHS] was erm... part of that one yeah.</p>
<p><strong>(Interrupted briefly 0:15:32.4 – 0:15:43.9)</strong></p>
<p><em>Don’t be silly..... Right, well.... Right, where were we then? We were erm... Let’s go back we were sort of talking about how numbers of migrants over a certain period could obviously....</em></p>
<p>That’s right so therefore that you had the reaction was far stronger and then at that time you had the National Front as well, who were coming out and this was erm... I think music to their ears that er.. yes you know we, we, we, and they say ‘Yeah we seen lot of people’ and so on. So...I..D...I...I mean I genuinely believe that there were lot of people who were not racially prejudiced, but who felt insecure and this insecurity was that the only way that they could come out with the words well you say ‘We don’t like blacks, why don’t they go home?’ Why something like that. And er.. and so therefore, oh, to label everyone would have been I think, the....</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>....with hindsight not that I believed it.... Because I lived in a area, I lived in erm... Vicarage Road, which is not that far from here and I don’t... our neighbours were our best support and I think that they certainly kept my faith in, in er... in, in, in, the British society because they were er.. more than er.. helpful more than genuine we used to go to their home, they’ll come to our home, they’ll supported us every way and erm.. if we had even some visitors and so on they’ll say ‘Look you can have stay in our home’ and so on, which was I think when we look at now it’s, it’s er... a very difficult thing like that, but so that was the balancing act certainly for me that er.... that would be I think would be unfair to label everyone. But the fact that many people were being beaten up and people were being exposed and people were being abused, women were frightened to go to street because you...... I must say that then there was also the problem then came of not only of the between the races, but of different communities because er... for the Asians became most, I think more victim than the Afro-Caribbean a: that they were more aggressive er 2: that they had something common with the English, because that was the culture, that was the language and that was the religion and so on. So you’ll see more.. there’s this socialising was taking place more whereas the Asians were a bit more isolated, so they were the I think in many cases er... the common enemy of both of those groups at time so whereas the issues of blackness we had common but in everything else there was this hostility and I think that so for Asian they were fighting on... started fighting on both fronts....er...... and erm....which, became very difficult and particularly for women who were a bit more timid, who were a bit more withdrawn, who were a bit more fearful, oh er... I think the the, the likes of Asian women, they wanted to wear jewellery and so on and they were often so snatched and so on. And that that created another fear....</p>
<p><em>Yeah. I think you sort of..... you said earlier in terms of numbers etc....or if you’re concentrated geographically that you do look perhaps like a larger group.....</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>...Then or your perceived as more of a threat. But, I think also your right I mean if you compare sort of the black communities and sort of the Asian communities visually there is a certain adoption of black culture....</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>...Where they will actually wear the same clothes.....</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>... As the western cultures.....</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>...Or the pre-existing cultures.....</em></p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><em>...The fact is; people of an Asian background have obviously religious identifications....</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>...Through the clothes, the jewellery......</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><em>Certain marks that they wear....</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>...I think the fact that you will visibly stand out a lot more in a group....</em></p>
<p>That’s right yes. And also because in terms of socialising that whereas the, the Afro-Caribbean and erm... English would er... internal relationships so you’ll have more boyfriend and girlfriend relationships, so there’ll be more common other.....</p>
<p><em>Sharing music</em></p>
<p>Music. Erm... whereas with the Asians it was totally different, so you had that kind of erm.. er sort of a different reaction, but I think that these some of these events [COUGHS] obviously brought to the fore.....</p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p>...The.. The.... The... The....hostility that was there so you had er.. with the National Front and others bringing out some of that er.. tho.. tho... those people who openly were hostile and will say ‘Look we don’t like you, we don’t want you you’re a... go back’ and so on to the others that who will [COUGHS] say ‘That erm... erm.... well no, no we all human being we will all need each other they come here at our invitation they are serving here they are not sort of beggars outside they’re not... they’re, they’re working hard’ and then and keeping peace and so on. They’re far more law abiding than some of the erm... maybe of the white youth or Afro-Caribbean youths so it was that balancing act that people were playing, but I think that time when we started the erm er... these, these groups that came up who were I mean er.. this this, this erm... erm campaign against racial discrimination and erm it had started for erm.. I think we wanted to positive we started to campaign for racial harmony, which I chair that for nea... some years and that was to look at beyond just having meetings, public meetings but work through schools, work through community groups so where we look at developing positive relationships where we encouraged people, for instance, encouraged schools to look at ways of helping people to understand each other look at understanding the cultures, religions and so on so seeing the commonalities and this we see it as a resource rather than as a liability and er to do more community work having concerts er we involving....so that that, that kind of positive work also started to work and which encouraged a lot of people rather than to be hostile or negative and being aggressive er.. than to do er..er...use their energies into positiveness.</p>
<p><em>Mmm mm.</em></p>
<p>So I think that there was some positive coming out of that that extreme thing that that which was happening.</p>
<p><em>Do you think, I mean if you sort of look at that period, you’ve mentioned it erm.. a couple of times certain things could perhaps light, certain torch lights could spark a bigger fire perhaps and you know I mean certain incidents such as B.N.P perhaps organising a rally in your local community or a local by-election where a right wing campaigner would stand....</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Erm.. another incident for example; perhaps, perhaps be the resettlement of a group of migrants that arrived in great numbers, which we’ll obviously go on to later with the Uganda Nations, and another one would have been Politicians......</em></p>
<p><em>Yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>Which I think you’ve probably mentioned the most infamous one there in a certain Enoch Powell, and I am aware of him because I actually grew up in his ward, like I’m from Wolverhampton so his ward is actually [LAUGHS] my political ward to this day erm... I have an old neighbour who erm... I mean this is, I’ll tell you my story here [LAUGHS] He erm.. arrived from Jamaica in erm... sixty-four and he lived in Liverpool for about three years didn’t really enjoy Liverpool erm... didn’t really understand the local dialect... </em></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>...[LAUGHS] I lived there I don’t understand it [BOTH LAUGH] he didn’t want to move down to London cos’ he had lots of friends down there, but he thought it would be too much competition for work erm... so he was looking for somewhere in the North and he quite liked the North apart from the weather so he found this place called the Black Country...</em></p>
<p>Mmmm<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>...And saw it on a map and he presumed, perhaps a little naively, it would be full of black people [BOTH LAUGH] and he arrived there and he ended up living two doors away from Enoch Powell and erm... to this day he sort of often sort of he will tell me about his relationship with Enoch, which erm... he describes as a love hate relationship.</em></p>
<p>Yeah<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>[LAUGHING] But I think that kind of my point is that certain politicians would actually aggravate....</em></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>...Race relations in the local community, but it seems to me that he wasn’t just the more underground groups or sort of ostracized groups, which was B.N.P and the N.F its almost as if those within even the Labour government and certainly the Conservative Party were also taking advantage of the situation...</em></p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p><em>...And I mean Callaghan was probably the XXXX Race Relations Act erm...</em></p>
<p>Yep<em>.</em></p>
<p>...<em>And there were others. I mean so can you tell me perhaps how you dealt with not just the local but also the national..</em></p>
<p>Yeah<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>...Issue?</em></p>
<p>I think that the, the, the, the, issue certainly in that because with XXXX groups and so on as we became more aware of it then we started linking up with other groups in other parts whether they were in East London or West London or Nottingham, Birmingham and so on because suddenly there were issues that were coming up. I think one of the thing was that er.. er.. you’re right that looking at politically; I mean Enoch Powell became very vocal but I think that your quite right there were many others some were very vocal that who were on the right wing of the, the, the erm... Conservative Party er... and who, who sort of, sort of echoed what Enoch Powell who, who was a champion and so on. But you also had other politicians that who erm.... for whom votes became very more ope.... er... important rather than the morality and then who will er... not probably say as vocal as, as er... or publically as Enoch Powell did but you will know that er... they underneath that they will be using the same tactics and so on and I think it was er... the height of... I mean... I’ve later on I became member of erm... erm... Nottingham Council and erm.... and it was then that er... I realised that how racist the Labour Party itself is that who will say one thing when the crunch comes that the when then they will say well ‘Nnnnoonn no this is not what..’ And they said ‘Well you, you believe in that’, you saying that you have... ‘I love curries’ ‘I love people’ ‘ I love that’ but when it comes to an issue er then you say ‘No, no, no this is our country’ and so on er... where is that that genuineness and so on and I think that at that time that suddenly people felt and particularly those that who did not erm... have the kind of immigration that er... we were coming to or where people feel that we didn’t want to alienate it er... but there, there was this prejudice there was this sort of er... may not be prejudice but I think that exploitation of the situation that they wouldn’t go to people and say ‘We must love thy neighbour’ thing then they say yes we, we, we must cut and they will use things like that ‘Yes we must cut down immigration we must bring down this one, we have not much capacity, we want to create a better relationship, we want to’ erm.. I think er... ‘Alleviate er... people’s fears’ and so on so indirectly that you were virtually saying ‘We know what you talking about’.</p>
<p><em>Your kind of putting a positive spin erm... on racism almost [LAUGHS] it’s... it’s....</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes but you saying is, is er what is not displeasing them but you saying in a way that, which you see well I just be erm... it’s just saying that ‘Look you know your right but we, we understand that people don’t like your beard and we understand that people don’t like the way you talk’ and so on but we want to make sure that people feel happy and so on which virtually is saying ‘Look we don’t like you.’ [LAUGHS]</p>
<p><em>You change, not us!</em></p>
<p>[LAUGHS] Yeah. That’s it. And I think there was that political pressure that’s why you had then certainly with the immigration rules of 1964 when they was rushed through XXXX, stopped people and successive governments through immigration rules, they’ve very positive moves have been made there all been to virtually play to the gallery, in a sense, because each election the, the immigration issue comes up each er.. er... election or each erm... at sort of at party po... erm... conferences this issue becomes one and I think that underneath that it is virtually er...people are reinforcing that er... people don’t have the er...oh not reached the stage where they said ‘Look hang on it’s enough is enough lets leave this out of politics lets leave this out of things lets look at the what are the real issue how we can er... help people to integrate into society and there are issues which are common to everybody not related to it why bring this issue of racism out?’ [CREAKING SOUND] So you have that kind of thing over the years and I think it was that slowly when the people became vocal, people became so you had then suddenly riots in different cities coming up then you had other pressures coming up and then I think that sometimes the governments were reacting to those pressures er.. rather than with conviction and that has been the tragedy ever since that er.. you need to have a riots in some of the streets to for some urgent action then again is the temporary one but that’s because reaction to that otherwise if people have been saying lot of thing or if as er... good governance or as a as a er.. for a positive change then you say well ‘Ok, we can see this thing sort of happening we want to do it for positive reasons rather than to reactions’, but unfortunately that, that’s the [CREAKING SOUND] kind of society we always li.... we are living in that where unless that er... er... I mean, I was talking to the, the Home Secretary then John Reed who came, moved to Leighton erm... youth centre once to consult with the community when I was involved and he was saying ‘Well you know one of the best thing we, we doing, look how much money we spending in prison building, how much money we doing in this one’ and erm.... and I stood up I said ‘Well, Home Secretary, er... I feel ashamed to be part of er... er... er... er... party that er... er.... er.... I’m committed party member served there for almost all my..... but I would be more happier if you said we are demolishing prisons, we are demolishing these institutions, which are dealing with this hatred thing and crime thing and we are demolishing things that, which will we’d because we don’t need them because of societies happier building more prison, reacting to thing after it happen’.</p>
<p><em>It’s band aid, mentality, always put the plaster on it.</em></p>
<p>It’s just there. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah well that’s not er... nothing to be proud of.</p>
<p><em>Papering over the cracks.....</em></p>
<p>And you just sort of reacting to the thing and then saying er.. and playing to the gallery in one sense and then making people temporary, and ‘Oh we doing this’ and ‘We stopping this oh we doing this’ and so on. Er that’s not the kind of society that’s er.... I would want our children to be living in rather that we are saying ‘Well we are taking positive action.. we tak....’ And this was also; I mean I remember that at that time there was a lot of hostility on the Priory Court Estate and in Chingford Estates where the policy was to bang every homeless or everybody in those high rise flats....</p>
<p><em>Undesirables of society.</em></p>
<p>Undesirables yes. Yes. Yeah and therefore you’re bound to get reaction, you bound to get that er.. if you put all the, the, the, the, the, people that who are er.. very aggressive, frustrated they going to fight with each other and then race will become issue and erm... and that was er... er... bad policy and we were saying to councils and other local government officers er... and er.... and central government that this kind of policy is er... not very helpful your virtually condemning the condemned er... and erm... your saying ‘No, no these are the bad ones we will just take them away and put them in together it’s just like sort of putting.. sending them to some island as punishment and so on what you expect from that?’ So you had to have that policy in housing it was also issued for education that what kind of er... education what kind of syllabus were we would teaching in schools and so on. What kind of erm... social facilities, environments I mean... I er.... I started my youth work in, in er late sixty-seven, late sixty-eight; where they say ‘Look we need to get Asian young people involved because we getting afro-Caribbean others erm if we want to socialise people because we can’t simply say let’s meet together for what? We need a common space where there was a cricket there where there was a sort of music there then so teaching each other’ and er... what we do we shut down all the youth centres er... and the ideas well ‘No, no we’ll have these teams of people who will go where the problem is’ so we said ‘Well.... it’s like another policing that you wait until something happen’ otherwise er... even that is no longer available that they say ‘That somebody break our windows or steals’ they said ‘Is it a personal injury? No. Fine we’ll just write it da, da...’ So you change away... and that time was the same one that where people was saying ‘Well where we going? What is happening? What kind of protection we have?’ When you have a large crowd of people that who the majority there er... who have children who have other insecurities and then you have social deprivation and that one then nobody taking action erm... And when I was in Nottingham the councillor I was chair of the Housing and we had this similar XXXX there were certain er... areas where no police will go and we’re saying ‘Well why you don’t go?’ He said ‘Well, they’re all drug addicts and so on so it’s better to leave them, so it’s a safety and we don’t want to go because they will have knives’ and so on I said ‘Well virtually you’re saying that that’s a no go area, you asking, and if who else will go there?’ And er.....</p>
<p><em>Drug</em> dealers and that’s it.</p>
<p>Those kind of....And so you have a similar kind of thing going on from that time, I said we haven’t learned anything from there. I’m glad that they’re now demolishing those flats and bringing down lower one, but obviously that has been because not because that there, there is er... er consciousness change because they were these high flats are expensive it was taking us twenty thousand [LAUGHS] pounds per year for every flat because er....</p>
<p><em>Not a social conscious more of a financial conscious. [LAUGHS]</em></p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes that was and I also said.... well I knew because well we’re sitting there and they said now we have to demolish this... I says ‘Why?’ ‘Because it’s costing us twenty thousand pounds a year so it’s financially not viable’. I read the Margret Thatcher’s erm.. plan for this er.. selling of things and so on er.. so you have these political manoeuvring going on over the years, which was to, for financial or political convenience rather than the needs of the people.</p>
<p><em>Mmm</em> <em>Hmm</em>.</p>
<p>And I think that and people read it differently and you have the racist group that who will use it through for their purposes and, and er.. I mean it was interesting that erm... erm.. why it was erm.. I think it was long after obviously ninety-six, ninety-seven, I was doing some work in Dockland area, and where they had elected the first B.N.P er.. on the council and I was asking people I say ‘Why did you say well you know we hate them, but we wanted to kick the Labour Party and this was the only way to, to, to, to, because they were doing things and so on not that we loved them but we, we....’</p>
<p><em>Protest voters.</em></p>
<p>Protest voters. But this is how the protest voters always manage life they look at what..how the people frustrated they’ll look at how people are emotionally disengaged from there and then they will come in and do it. And we think why wait, why wait, why don’t you do something about? So yeah, so I mean, it’s been a different.</p>
<p><em>Mmm. Hmm. So I mean if again we can overview leading up to the late sixties and early seventies then you’ve got seems to me quite a disjointed, erm society erm and then you’ve got other er... agitators and say political actors kind of taking advantage of it, the outside, and on top of that all of a sudden in the late sixties after this mass economic migration you start to have these resettlement of migrants...</em></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>...who were actually arriving because of persecution..</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>...back home and in the mix obviously you had sort of East Africa seemed to come to the fore in the late sixties, early seventies, because of the upheaval that was going on in that part of the world, so can you perhaps [SMACKS LIPS] talk more about your specific role perhaps the erm... So you said you joined the resettlement erm... board...</em></p>
<p>Right<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>...Can you tell me perhaps where you were when you heard about Idi Amin when he made his rather crazy proclamation that no one quite believed initially ‘You’ve got 90 days to get out!’</em></p>
<p>Yes.... I mean obviously we were, we were, er.. seeing er... Idi Amin few years before when he came to power and er.. his er.. craziness erm.. particularly when he invited Callaghan to visit him and he picked a small hut because he said ‘He wanted a white man to bow him’ and normal circumstances no will do that [LAUGHS] so it was er... er... a demonic sort of er... er... act of er... sort of thought that he said ‘Well ok, I’ll, I’ll erm... make sure’,but that was, that showed his idiocy as his craziness that er.. we say ‘Well you know these kind of er.. gimmicks don’t make you any greater’ and so on but that was him.</p>
<p><em>In the same way that Enoch Powell’s gimmick of...</em></p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p><em>Political speech didn’t make him particularly successful politician.</em></p>
<p>That’s right. That’s right. Because when you are in that position you are more responsible you have to think very carefully, you have to think that the implication of that it maybe at that time very er... plausible or very self erm... promoting but it is damage to it’ll do to er.. the society if er.. long time. And erm so yes... Idi Amin was there but nobody expected that he will [CLINKING SOUND] er.. act one day soon particularly that erm when the Asian community in Uganda were very prominent, were successful business men and so on and we believed that when he started some of the people were coming from Uganda, Kenya, Nir... Tanzania at that time they were indicating that er... you know the man is crazy he’s er.. he see’s Asian’s as a threat er... and he see’s that he expects that they will promote him they’ll give money and so on and there a bit more of a different level and he had his advisors and so on you know who say look these people are this that and the other and like in any society you get that er... until that he reached a stage where he said ‘I’ll give you ninety days to get out of this and that’ and people believed that ‘No, no it’s no more than a threat er... he will probably be well pressure’, and so on, and er... obviously Robert Carr, whose Lord Carr, now was the Home Secretary at that time and who was er... Pressurising erm...for other countries, commonwealth countries saying look ‘No. No. Hang on be, be sort of what’s the problem? But I think that he thought he was as a might but er... he everybody’s coming to him and he said ,Brrr, your either take nationality or you get out’, and so on and I think for a lot of people obviously, that we knew of later on they said ‘Well, they felt that if this crazy man is like that even if we became national we have nothing he could nationalise everything, he can prosecute us, he can throw us out again’, so many of the upper-class and middle-class people thought no, no the best thing is to go.</p>
<p><em>Those who could afford to leave early as well</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes that’s it although the ordinary working-class they had nothing to...to... most of them weren’t nationals anyway, but it was the only erm... the business community that who erm held British Passports or Pakistani or Indian or other one. And er... I think that once they realised that people when the people started coming they said ‘Well, well now that that this treat is there so whether they will... he will persecu... er.. or put in practise or not people say no, no enough is enough we are going’, and so the whole influx. And so to organise this the government set up the Ugandan Nations resettlement board nationally and erm... then they obviously in order to work they asked local people to help erm... in er... providing support and so in the East London a number of churches and a number of community groups they got together and they sort of set up the local er... Ugandan Nations resettlement committee er... which, was to help resettle people in this area and erm..</p>
<p><em>So can you ask how erm.. obviously, he was organised at a local level but what input did the national government actually have at this point?</em></p>
<p>Well the national government it was the national board obviously...</p>
<p><em>[COUGHS]</em></p>
<p>Were liaising with us in terms of a: providing information about where the refugees is when they coming and erm... where they are staying and erm... so that they could have space for so many and so on and secondly; was about their background about what sort of say for instance that if they were Hindu’s or Sikh’s or Muslim’s so that we will know that which, community will be easier to do that... also the kind of skills that they’re having so that if there are local erm... needs for jobs and so on so it could be easily done er... education so that we will know that how many children are involved so how many schools will be needed what sort of thing and so on so we can begin to look at er... talk with people schools and so on. That’s the kind of thing that was there er... and er... so once we started work the local community relation council was to act as er...one of the chief executive directors secretary administrator. So first of all was our role was to see that look can we, we needed to have some local accommodation.</p>
<p><em>What do they need? What do we have?</em></p>
<p>What do we have? And erm...sort of and what we need to what are the gaps and what are the things like that? So there was erm... a big building in Chingford erm.... trying to remember it’s er... number where it was a large hall, where we’d start to bring in the families so they would come to their er... their, their centres, their camps then they will be moved to different parts of the country and we handled about hundred and seventy families in... in... East London and erm... so it was that when they come in we’ll obviously have a registration, we will work with the local job centre see what sort of jobs are available and match them with them and erm... Secondly liaise with the school to see that what sort of age range children are there and so on what they can do and... Registering with the doctors [CLINCKING SOUND] erm... if they were disabled or any other physical or social needs then they say ‘Oh with the social services’. So it was the local authorities were involved as well so there was all the er... agencies that, who would have to provide something so they were helping and supporting and er... as people the first part was actually sitting there and making them feel at home er... lot of them obviously left because they could only carry twenty ‘k’ or whatever they and some of the people who had less possessions there they were much at least comparatively better off because they didn’t leave that much behind but those who had large number for example live in palatial houses and servants and cars and so on they left every thing there so for them to mentally er... be, be sort of settling here was is a re traumatic process is similar er not as er.. similar to the immigration process that we came because we came ourselves where they were forced to.. to come there.</p>
<p><em>Yeah. I think there is a big difference between... I mean obviously you starting off this whole thing cultural adaption and perhaps experienced the same prejudice that they experience, but I think in the mind set of an individual and I say you know I say this I have been an economic migrant before I’ve lived in the U.S but erm... I’ve certainly never been a forced refugee or experienced religious or political persecution, but I think in terms of your own identity, as a migrant, it can change your perception of the world and not only the way that people perceive you but the way the way you perceive them, if your if you got that status as asylum seeker or refugee. So I agr... yeah.... it probably a very dawned on them.....</em></p>
<p>Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Because here you are forced to er... go somewhere with nothing at all leaving behind a luxurious life all your possessions and so on and erm... there was this... this initial er... helping them get some of our members some of our families to meet with them and erm... help them to just feel at home and they were provided with food, provided with... and most of them obviously it wasn’t the kind of thing that we provided them from a hotel and so on but they... they could do it and so on they wanted I mean.... the main thing was that they wanted to live with dignity and they didn’t just want to be seen as beggars and so on they say look ‘All we need is some parts, all we need is this one’ and so on and then we’ll and then slowly..... Most of them were obviously because they were business men and so on so they were very creative some of them said ‘No, no, we don’t want any money we want to... tell us what our opportunities are there we will set up our own’. Whether it was some small shop or some selling from home and so on. And erm.... I think that we also needed to deal with the public and how they see reaction because they were erm... it was er.. like erm... I remember er... not connected with this but er... my earlier years erm... in, in, in, hostility that there were a group of young people that who erm... where in Chingford bikers and so on who were always very aggressive ‘No no!’ they said [IN A GRUFF TONE] and the youths worker there he asked me to come ‘Can you come and talk with them?’ so I said ‘Ok’ and the thing is that it was the... the numbers games sort of saying ‘You know all these people are coming here they’re taking our jobs, they’re taking our this’ and so on the same XXXX and so I said ‘How many people you think live in Walthamstow?’ ‘Oh two-million’ I said ‘Well there are not er... two hundred and fifty – two hundred thousand people are in total how can be two million?’ erm..... How many in jobs – ‘Oh they’re taking all our jobs, sixty percent our jobs’ I said ‘Well, they can’t be because they are only five percent of them’ and, and when we and the kind of figures they come up with it was enormous and I said ‘Well where do you get these ideas?’ ‘Oh yes’, everybody says ‘No, no, they don’t they no two million if you include all Afro-Caribbean, all Asian, all non-English there’s not two million in the whole country never mind in Walthamstow’. er... so you have that kind of sort of peoples stuck in there they ‘Oh yes, my God there’s er...’ and you exaggerate so same was here that they thought all these millions of people are going to come they say ‘No, no they are not million they’re only I think it was about eighty thousand people that who were totally going to be quite a number of them going to be....quite a number of them went to Pakistan to India but most quite a large number went....</p>
<p><em>I think twenty-eight thousand came to Britain eventually, but I’d say that was probably evenly split between Leicester and London. So London itself probably only got about twelve thousand...</em></p>
<p>That’s right yes... Because they tried to divert most people into the other commonwealth countries; so you had this one and er... one of the interesting thing was erm... quite a bigger hostility came from the Asian community themselves and erm... I was constantly approached you know ‘Don’t... don’t... settle them here!’, you know and I said and there reason was different they felt it a threat they said ‘Well here for a long time they lived under this camouflage of we’re Muslims erm... we, have a different language we have a different language we don’t deal with this we don’t with....’ Here these were the same Muslims people most of them but very open and very sort of erm... liberal in their thing. So lot of them thought well and er... the reason they gave is said you know these people they come in and they will.. they are very liberal they go out for parties and so on and they saw it as a threat, which, was very strange I said ‘Well they’re our people; if nobody else they’re our people, in a sense not only they’re, they’re only Pakistani Asian or what background and so on but they’re refugees they’re here, they need our support’ and er.... Out of all the groups - why you? I thought that you will be the one what who will be saying ‘Well there are our people we will we will give them’, but there was a strange reason they felt that they will come they will bring a different standard, they will have bit more liberal attitude about relationship, about boys going, girls going out, marriages all the thing and this will threaten our sort of cosy little thing er... of course we said well that’s a silly thing and it’s not in our remit and so on but I will rather that you help but if you can’t help just keep your mouth shut don’t be like the National Front and erm... so we, we, we, managed to settle erm... families slowly er... local authority found some houses for them some of them who were smaller families rented places erm... people started getting... there was quite a lot of them were skilled for getting jobs as well er... people I think it was er... during the year that almost ninety percent were, were settled er... and one reason because they themselves were so enthusiastic they felt them self er... so willing to do.... go out of their way to do it that most of the younger people will be searching jobs every day. Most of the girls will be going out and saying ‘Look’ and they didn’t feel shamed and they say ‘Look we need we don’t want to be burden on the state we don’t want to be staying in a hostel’.</p>
<p><em>Why do you think that was? Because I mean... the thing...I mean we’ll go on to this perhaps later in terms of; but,... but I mean the Ugandan Asians migrants are kind of held up as almost the most successful erm... forced migrant group ever to arrive on the shores of Britain and I’d probably argue over all as well as seen as probably the most successful and they’re almost used as like the shining example of how migration can work. </em></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><em>Anybody who is pro-migration will always use Ugandan Asians as an example of how it can work....</em></p>
<p>Yes...</p>
<p><em>...If dealt with properly...</em></p>
<p><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>...Why do you think that was? I mean you’ve men... you’ve touched on it the fact that they had this kind of resounding need not to be a burden and but.. but even so where does that come from do you think?</em></p>
<p>I think that they was... that there was this was ... first of all that they were the kind of people that who were successful in their life, people that who had skills in their life and people who had pride in themselves and they were saying ‘Well we did not come here erm... so were not sort of erm... looking at up to other people we came because we were forced to it but, we still have our own pride, we still have our own dignity we still want to.. we can do things and if given the opportunity’ or they were saying ‘Look, erm.. just give us a space er... were we want to stand on our own feet’. They were not the labour class working that who were saying ‘Look we don’t know anything, we don’t have thing so we just need a job’ and so on – they were saying look ‘Ok we need this space; we need to just maintain our self respect and dignity’ because they came from that area; and then the, they were saying ‘Well we have something to offer, we are... Compared to the other where they were simply looking for a labour position’, they were saying ‘No we have skills, we have knowledge, we have experience and erm... We just want to be on our own’. Because they felt that the life they lived to be here was erm... Very erm... undignified er... and they say look ‘The sooner we want to get out of here, the sooner we want to stand on our own two feet and I think there was this desire to be er... standing on their own feet er... it was not that well we’ll see, well we’ll ... it was not the kind of thing that they will say well ‘Ok we’ll live here as long as we can and until they push us out’ they say ‘No, no we, we want to get on we want to build our – re-build our life we want to be as successful as we... they are there and we want to just be our self, we don’t want to be numbers, we don’t want to be er... registering everything, we don’t want people coming in and like er.. erm... we are on a show piece - these are the refugees!’ and so on’ so they felt that this was erm... it would be less humiliating if we just get on with our life as ordinary as well so we’re not a different breed. I think these were combination of that that self rights, self determination er.. based on skills, the knowledge and seeing that the lifestyle they had and there they said ‘Want to get out’ and erm.. Particularly settle down and get our children into that mode that we are not sort of totally different so they don’t have this inferiority complex building up.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that erm... I mean I certainly completely agree I mean this interview isn’t about my perception it is about yours, but from the interviews I’ve conducted so far it seems that there was this motivation amongst the community erm... to achieve the status that they had worked hard for previously</em>. [BOTH COUGH]</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>We have discussed already that like with any other migrant group, including you yourself when you arrived here in 1964, I presume, there’s a certain cultural adaption that you have to do erm... First thing most people say erm... if you’ve come from, say a more tropical part of the world, it’s the weather. That seems to be the British weather I mean, it’s become- you know I mean it’s become almost a cliché of what you have [LAUGHS] to deal with in Britain erm... But, I mean would you say that they er.. it helped the fact that they came from a colonial power? And you know it just seemed to me erm... with the Ugandan Asians that did arrive a lot of the Guajarati violence mainly had already been chucked to Uganda in the first place to actually work in the bureaucracy of the British system and so they were quite aware of the British system I think they were also quite aware of like the culture of Britain they say even though it was within Uganda erm.. as a colonial power – do you think that helps? Do you think that helped the transition that perhaps other groups didn’t have to deal with?</em></p>
<p>Yep. I think so, and you’re absolutely right and this is what I was saying is that because the kind of status and because of the kind of position and because of the closeness to the powers there, and er... obviously some of them had been there for long, long time some of them were the er...er... oh...er...the <strong>defecto</strong>.. I mean... rulers underneath the British XXXX so they were er... well aware... and they had all the privileges, the knowledge and skill of the system and society and I think that was one of the reason why the British also choose they were very selective in their saying that who will be the one and so on and because they felt that these would be assets to us and they knew it and all of the other working class and so on they will go because they will feel a bit more comfortable there. So yes, because they understood the structure they understood the, the, the, the, er... way the system works as well as much as er... far more than labour migrants one. So it was easier for them to adjust because they knew the language most of them were well spoken and so on quite a lot of children were well educated and so on they were successful business people and so they knew that the... how to develop [DING DONG] and the.... all they were saying give us the space we will do that and they knew that they how they sort of er... relate to other people at a higher level and I think they, these were the er... all the part of the ingredients for their being successful, when they wanted to move on.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, completely. Erm can we move back to erm sort of you’ve mentioned you - almost two kind of characters [BACKGROUND TALKING] that were in the resettlement camps that your eventually your board had to deal with and help allocate resources to erm... the perhaps higher echelons in society the more successful ones er... who actually...</em></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><em>You said you could see they were because they had a few more possessions than the others... [LAUGHS] </em></p>
<p>Yes...</p>
<p><em>It also had the ones who were lesser – it’s almost like a dual system within that group erm... Can you perhaps tell me about some of the individuals that you met – I mean did you ever go to the resettlement camps or were you just....</em></p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p><em>Can you tell me about the sort of eyes you looked into the emotions they were showing as they came off the plane perhaps, perhaps put a more human side to it, to the story.</em></p>
<p>I mean I wasn’t there when they came out of plane that was dealt by the central one but, when the people were coming erm.. I mean we went to the, the, the, this camps resettlement camps but then we... as they came here in Waltham Forest that was one of the campaigns here er, one was here in er I think it was erm... that hall in, in, in East London so there were two centres and I would go regularly er.. other people won’t but I made my business to go and talk with them and I think that the er.. I mean the, the feeling I was getting that there was erm... er.. ss.... very pride I mean see that it was not something people were crying out oh we left this possession and so on they were saying well ok they erm [SNIFFS] erm... they didn’t let us feel that they have that they defeated that they were saying well yes we have had obviously er... this bad experience of course that we er.. that we had this sort of most of our possession gone but we still have confidence in our self we will built up we will live I mean when you talk to erm... them and they say and they will share their stories and they said that erm... one man said ‘Look I had erm two large stores, I had employed so many people and how I built it up how I started from a little shop and how I built it up how I invested lot of money in charity community groups there’ and so on and I would ask them ‘Well, why didn’t you stay there?’ er... he say well we could have but I think that we, we could see the writing on the wall that er.. the kind of mentality that was coming out the kind of this that you could feel the same in some other countries where you built up and hysteria and anti community that it was question that now we can handle XXXX tomorrow our lives would be at risk, so we have taken that choice and we said ‘ok we can built up we have the basic skills, knowledge, XXXX’ and er this comes and goes doesn’t matter but we save ourselves our children and so on. And they say we feel sad, sad that we what we’ve done to the nation, sad that all we have invested all our life and that has not been valued er we still hope that someday we can go back er.. but we, we, we, are not defeated.</p>
<p><em>Do you think it helps in terms of success – I mean you’ve touched on something there ‘they’d hope they’d go back’, and I know sort of once Amin died you had proceeding governments but it really wasn’t until the current government sort of over the last few years that actually genuinely they...</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Turned around and said you can come back and we will actually compensate you with what you lost forty years ago, thirty-five years ago..</em></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Erm... would you think the fact that we talked about the success of the Uganda Nations Asian community... I mean in terms of entrenching themselves within British society, financial society most certainly and British culture as well..</em></p>
<p>Yes... Yes.</p>
<p><em>I mean, their sort of celebrated – I was chatting to <strong>Prafal Patel</strong> during the interview and he sort of celebrates the cultural effect that Ugandan Asians had on Britain with the ‘corner shop’ mentality, he pretty much sort of the feet of the Ugandan Asian community erm... Do you think the fact that they know they were refugees the fact that they didn’t really foresee themselves going back in the short term, regardless of the long term dreams of returning back the reality was whilst Amin was there they were not gonna be there....</em></p>
<p>Yeah...</p>
<p>Do you think that helped with them actually secure sort of like plant roots and build foundations in Britain – ‘Cos they knew this was it.. there wa... not many of them were really cos’ I think it seems a lot of them were percieved as being Indian or Gudurati but a lot of them hadn’t even been to India i’ve done interviews with the children of Ugandan migrants - So do you think that helps?</p>
<p>I think so, i think that because it was er...a XXXX at that time, I mean that they, they’ve travelled that’s it as far as Ugandan are concerned but they left it there and for them Idi Amin could live another fifty years and so on. They said well look we’ll change it most of them feel this chapter is closed we don’t want to be just living in hope they said ok we want to build up this is our country now we are here we want to build up and build up on our experiences and resources whatever we have and move on. I think that determination was very helpful because they were not in two boats, they were not saying well maybe we’ll wait, maybe we’ll sit in dirty eastender for two years and maybe we’ll go back but no I think they’re, they’re this was the best thing positive things that they were saying nope it’s chapter is closed we are here – we are here because of our choice they say well ok we we limited choices but we could have chosen to accept that and take the risk and hope maybe it never happen and so on but on the other hand we say no this is erm... we don’t want to live in this once this is starting this when you have like in Kenya, Mau Mau thing when you have other like in er... Zimbabwe when you have Mugabe’s crowneys and so on; so you you they say look ok we feel that once somebody has put our whole life work on stake and question mark then they say well we will could see the writing on the wall they say ok its better to go while we are we can. And so I think that was the determination they say we want to build up we don’t want to live off state, we don’t want to do anything of this but we want to build up I think that that helped tremendously.</p>
<p><em>And let’s go back to obviously your role within the board, well not just specifically your role I mean the role of the board itself – who made up the resettlement board?</em></p>
<p>The The The local one?</p>
<p><em>The local one – yeah.</em></p>
<p>The local one was you had most of the churches, you had most of the community organisations like the Community Relations Council and all the other er groups that who were interested you had the Pakistani, Indian, Bangladeshi community groups so it was er about forty, fifty groups that who were there they were all part of that one of course after that we had about twelve member executive that who will XXXXX that one. And that was as I say primarilly like the Community Relations Council; erm.. the political parties they had their representatives then you had the some of the churches and some of the community organisations, so it was very much a mixture bag of local...</p>
<p>Umbrella...</p>
<p>Yes. Yes...</p>
<p>And would you say that.. was there any surprising aspects of this cos’ you said I mean we’ve discussed the community that was you know pretty divided at the time, erm and not just this community....</p>
<p>Yes...</p>
<p>I mean society in Britain in general certainly society that had mixed multicultural erm.. population, erm... were you surprised? I mean you were talking about the silent majority earlier, I mean were any of these silent majority actually come out and cos.... you’ve obviously erm the resettlement will have required a lot of volunteers?</p>
<p>Yes...</p>
<p>A lot of people opening their homes...</p>
<p>Yes...</p>
<p>You know, their sort of like, offering people a sofa to sleep on were you surprised by the.. perhaps the...</p>
<p>I think that yes it was that when you sort of er... when we started saying to people we need help and so on that the number of people, particularly the English people coming in was erm... was certainly surprising abnd erm... who would er... some would say well we can come and erm serve the sort of talk with people, some will come and say well we can take them around, some of them will say they can come and stay with us and so on. And quite a number of them [CREAKING SOUND] offered accommodation which was obviously helpful because they said well flats there which suited some people and so on. And some people will erm.. erm... will say look ok we can organise some cultural thing and so on. I think that was the best out of it erm... obviously you will always get a sizeable people come in but coming out which was very encouraging for some of these and they they apprieciate and this is the best welcome we can expect we thought that maybe we hear about the hostilities and we hear about this thing but this is the best one and I think we we wanted to play on that, we wanted to say look how good the community relations we have how good the local people are in their their desire to welcome people and so on. And erm how much they are willing to accommodate these new cultures, new systems and so on erm.. we didn’t get erm... that many from the Afro-Caribbean community er, but they were still sizeable particularly through churches because you had the black churches far more helpful and er.. so they will say well look we can they’ll organise some time luncheon for them in their churches bring these people to mix up with people and erm... so I think that that was the exciting part of it that you had so many good people coming out erm... supporting erm... these small number of people erm.. from a different country although there was hostility in terms of erm... against Idi Amin and so on... Erm... that was understandable generally, but certainly erm...we’ve found that people were helpful er... I mean to say apart from some Asian community leaders I mean underneath some of the the individuals er...such I mean we’ve got a number of young girls who say ‘look we can talk with young girls there help them to understand what the sort of schooling system and so on so we’ll take them to school – to take them to some time see City of London and so on simillar with boys as well that we can perhaps organise a five-a-side cricket club and so on things to keep them engaged and keep them making a at home as much as possible.</p>
<p><em>Just integrate them...</em>[BOTH TALK AT ONCE] <em>XXXXX aspect</em></p>
<p>Yes...that’s right.</p>
<p><em>I mean are you proud of your work? I mean I don’t... again I am specifically about the resettlement board here because that’s the topic but I mean I’m quite aware of your work in terms of community involvement I’ve read Joel’s interview, which he enjoyed greatly may I add [LAUGHTER] erm.. yeah.. you’re very.... I mean you look back out of all the things you’ve done do you see the resettlement your role in the resettlement board as quite an important part of that?</em></p>
<p>I think that... I think that it was erm... certainly when with hindsight I feel very happy erm.. for two things one is that er.. I learnt a great deal, how the community works in crisis I feel that I learned a great deal how that we can pull resources together in times of crisis – I feel pride that I was able to to help and some of those were not that many of older people left there, but they’re some that when I see them and they still come and kiss my hand sometimes I’ll go out of way they remember that and I think that gives me pride that erm.. people although I didn’t do that much erm.. I mean I feel I wish I could have done far more [COUGHS] but at least that if people remember that well those times that you did well and erm... I dfeel that er.. yes it does makes me very, very happy that I was able to make contribution er.. in the [COUGHS] thinking that if I was in their position I would hope somebody will do the same er.. if nothing else make me feel important er... when you go to them and they feel somebody’s come to see us and syay look we are here to support and help in whatever we... it gives them tremendous erm... energy... tremendous help and a boost in their morale sort of er... sort of... feeling and thinking and that in itself is something which makes me very happy and erm... I ‘m glad that we were able to help them to help them settle all of them some of them were successful business’ very few have gone back [COUGHS] erm... and erm... obviously some when the opportunities came well I think [ COUGHS] they went back couple of times just to see things but [COUGHS] most of them feel happy settled here they feel that they made it and they are now they don’t want to erm... create another upheaval in their lives. I think most of the children don’t want to go back [COUGHS] i think in they’ve seen the whole [COUGHS] part of Africa is not very settling and so it we better there – so yeah – it makes me happy, it makes me erm... proud of what we did altogether collectively, [COUGHS] and I was glad that I was erm... able to spend so much time. At the end I did end up in hospital for exhaustion and so on but erm... erm... it was erm.. nothing I think because at least we, we undertook something and we were able to [COUGHS] I thought that we maybe able to erm... not finish in one year [COUGHS] time because the pressure was there but I think our determination, their determination and their own willingness to help themselves was the best part of it yeah.</p>
<p>I mean you said that it was it only as year you were sipulated?</p>
<p>Sorry?</p>
<p>Where you only sipulated a year? Or were you aware that you had to get it done within a year?</p>
<p>No. It was just because at the end of the year we had almost done....</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I think there was only about five or six famillies left.</p>
<p>That’s quite a good turnover – is it a hundred and seventy did you say?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Impressive.</p>
<p>Very well. And I said that because everybody worked very hard and I think that as we saying that because everybody was so keen to move on and get settled and so on so for them the year was for some too long. But for us I think that knowing the nature of things and was is erm.. so so yeah but but because at the end of year [COUGHS] I needed to go to university so then I decided no the work is done and then I can go XXXX.....</p>
<p>XXXX You did mention like a couple of instances where you XXXX the elders XXXX and move to other parts of the country and still here; how do you feel now when you see them perhaps walking with their grand kids around the area, you know?</p>
<p>I think that the [COUGHS] I mean about erm... six months ago I was at a session [COUGHS] poetry session [COUGHS] that I was presiding, one gentlemen who was a poet as well, very elderly now [SNIFFS] he brought his grandson [COUGHS] and erm.. he said afterward, he said erm... er.. this is a man and erm... I wanted him to know that who was here to welcome us and help us and wanted him to remember that and then he said look I wanted er.. he the grandson he was about ten – eleven now – he said we wanted to have a photograph with you and erm... I think that made me proud, that made feel very happy that erm... after all those years the third generation and he still remembers that and he values that and he still wanted him to have a photograph with me and to remember and tell – he said [COUGHS] my grandfather always tells me that story and because I used to go and spemd some time talking with them because of erm... [BABY CRYING IN BACKGROUND] erm... I had more time because I was going to university so I had a year off so I could. I had one English erm.. Pat erm... erm.. I’ll remember her name; she’s erm... she used to live in Billericay but she had a shop erm....this erm... in a high street market stall and erm... she was erm... very enthusiastic about her and I didn’t have a car that time, she had a car so she will everyday take me everywhere and we used to go there and erm... so [COUGHS] at that time when we felt lonely in oneself although we had large number of people and some of them knew each other but in a strange country in a strange place that you spend so much time making us feel at home and erm... so XXXX I think that whole; it’s just so grateful, I’m so grateful to them I said sometimes people forget and erm they say well it’s come and gone it’s.... erm... I never forgotten as well you saying it’s part of the job, part of work we do and you don’t want to simply saying well I’m the one who did this and so on we were part of it and we do a whole range of things it was good to remember.</p>
<p>I think that’s very modest of you as well – Dr Khan to be honest... I think ....</p>
<p>Well... erm... but yeah I mean feel that erm... I always looked at things and said well what if I was in their shoes – what if I was there what would be I expecting if nothing else sympathy, care; warmth, can’t do anything else at least let er.....and the worst thing will be when you are down people walk away and I think that that erm... they had everything at that time except that they were refugees er... in a different land, penniless er... and erm... all they needed at that time was saying look be sympathetic.. Give us space and this was least we could have done.</p>
<p>And the rest they helped themselves XXXX</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Erm... We’ll start to wind it up now, erm... you’ve covered pretty much – I mean this is a great sound bites there....</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I think it’s really important because a lot of the interviews we’re doing are either people who actually were part of the resettlement period themselves or their children and I think that it is very important to get your perspective cos’ you’re the almost; not an outsider you’re very much an integral part of the machine....</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Logistical support. But I think also you were there and you can give a bit more of an outsiders perception about what actually went on...</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>During that period. On top of that then I’m gonna ask you – do you think erm... in terms of the resettlement board if obviously I have got your email address erm... I’d like for this project – I’ve told you we’ve signed up with Praful Patel, and he’s gonna be really useful in sort of....</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><em>Outreach into the Ugandan Asian community in London erm... but what I’d quite like is to try and get as many perceptions of people like you actually people who took part who were I know you’re not British but you actually were British entitled you’re part of the British establishment lets say the local community people who actually helped Ugandan Asians when they arrived so perhaps in the next few weeks I will contact you via email erm perhaps if you can try and start thinking of people who are on the resettlement board in the local area, look people who are still alive and around I appreciate it was over forty years ago – you know it’s not exactly – I barely remember what happened yesterday [LAUGHTER] So yeah, if you can start to think of people who might be useful and might have a useful perception of what actually happened I’d really appreciate that. </em></p>
<p>Yep. No problem.</p>
<p><em>And I think beyond that all I have to say is thank you very much sir... I really do appreciate it.. I can turn this thing off now so I don’t have to write all this down...</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
