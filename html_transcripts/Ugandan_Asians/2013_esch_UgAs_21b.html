<p>You’re to, you’re to really ask somebody else, more detail about this. But, as I remember there was one Jewish company. Very successful Jewish company. Who wish to build a road, and err, do XXX building. XXXX was very proud of that particular Jewish company. There were quite a few people, and they were asked to leave. The company was taken over by government and then they were asked to leave. Before Indian were asked to leave, because they</p>
<p><em>What time was this roughly then?</em></p>
<p>The company name, I’ve forgotten this. It was in nineteen seventy one I think, he threw them out, he asked them to leave</p>
<p><em>Just, just before the Indians left?</em></p>
<p>Year before the Indian people were asked to leave.</p>
<p><em>Hmm</em></p>
<p>That time we all felt that our turn will come, but then we thought no, no, no, never. That was a small company with few Indians. Small community, not big community. There we are XXXX</p>
<p><em>What were the Jewish community like in Uganda?</em></p>
<p>Them not very. One synagogue, and very few community.</p>
<p><em>So it was quite a small one?</em></p>
<p>There were 3, or 400 people I think. I believe. I’m not very sure.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>I never took much interest in it. I remember, something happened in the Jewish community. This Jewish company, particularly XXXX company, was asked to leave immediately, within twenty four hours. Because he was controlling the total roadwork, officer, this company from the XXXX… And Jewish were trying to take entry in East Africa at that time. But Israeli, from Israel. So they were thrown out first, then Indian turn came. You’d better ask somebody else this question. Praful maybe knowing it.</p>
<p><em>Hmm</em></p>
<p>I’m, I’m not very a hundred per-cent about it. But I remember the Jews were thrown out first. That was not done as big a way as the Asian community</p>
<p><em>Of course, yeah</em></p>
<p>Asian, we were seventy thousand, and they were only three hundred, or four hundred. And they were quietly kicked out. Not much XXXX and they didn’t speak about it much. But I remember the managing director of the Jewish company was a XXXX in my rotary club, and one Friday disappeared, so we came to know that he was asked to leave.</p>
<p><em>What were you thinking at that point, when you heard that he, he was asked to leave?</em></p>
<p>I mean, I mean it though. Definitely he was asked to leave. And then it came out that every Jews were leaving because of him. They were XXXX asked to go.</p>
<p><em>Because they were so successful?</em></p>
<p>They were so successful in road building, yeah. Road building and transport. Thereafter, if you remember, if you know history of Uganda. Jewish people had to… Israeli people had to go by plane and release some Jewish people from there. Do you know that? I don’t remember which year, but Amin had captured some Jewish people, put in prison, in a very bad prison. And Israeli commandos went by Israeli plane, landed in the prison, released them, and took them back. That, that happened. And successfully. Uganda army, by that time the Ugandan army could reach XXXX by plane</p>
<p><em>Do you remember when you heard about that?</em></p>
<p>We heard immediately. We know that… we followed day to day, every day routinely on the…. If it happened in…. they landed at 2 o clock night, and they, they, they left just in one, by 4 O’clock they took off. All prisoners, they took all prisoners. Not a single Israeli was left in XXXX. That happened in nine… If you read, err… Do you know XXXX?</p>
<p><em>No</em></p>
<p>Ask Praful to get you a book. Write down…</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>Ask him to get you a book of the… Mr XXXXX has written a book about Uganda. Just recently, about three or four years ago. Which is mainly connected to XXXX group, but there are references about all this in the book.</p>
<p><em>Okay</em></p>
<p>Book XXXX… I tell you, what is the book called? I’ll ask my son, I think he’ll know. My copy, I think I’ve given him.</p>
<p><em>I can look it up. </em></p>
<p>It’s available from Amazon. You can buy from there.</p>
<p><em>No problem. I can look it up and see. </em></p>
<p>My son has gone to Istanbul, but ask Praful give a name of book Mr. XXXX has written about the XXXX empire, in which you’ll find all these references</p>
<p>[PHONE BEEPS]</p>
<p>My son, he’s gone to Istanbul today, for the day, I forgot.</p>
<p><em>Just for the day?</em></p>
<p>He left this morning at Seven O’clock, and he’s coming back in the evening. My XXXX. That way we are connected. He will tell me what he is doing, where he is going.</p>
<p><em>Yeah</em></p>
<p>That way we are close. But this book, you must read it.</p>
<p><em>Oh, I will do</em></p>
<p>It will give you lot about Uganda</p>
<p><em>I’ll look it up, thank you. </em></p>
